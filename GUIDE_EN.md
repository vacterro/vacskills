# SAIPEN Guide (Explain Like I'm Five, Grandpa Edition)

Listen here, rookie. The problem is simple: your AI agents have the memory of a goldfish. Yesterday you spent half a day explaining your architecture, and today you open a fresh chat and it starts building everything from scratch while asking stupid questions.

**SAIPEN** is just a damn notebook. A hard, fireproof notebook that sits in the `.saipen/` folder right inside your project.

The agent wakes up, opens this notebook (`STATE.md` and `BOARD.md`), sees exactly which line of code it left off at yesterday, and gets back to work. No whining, no repeating yourself.

## How to fire it up (for the specially gifted)

**Step 1. Beat the rules into the agent's skull (Once per machine)**
You have agents living on your machine (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, whatever). Download SAIPEN and run the script. It writes a global rule into their brains telling them to always read the notebook.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vacterro/saipen
cd saipen
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\bootstrap\inject.ps1     # Windows
bash bootstrap/inject.sh                                            # macOS / Linux
```

**Step 2. Start it in your project**
Open your terminal or editor in your project folder, call the agent, and tell it straight to its face:
> `saipen SET` 

It will grumble, create an `.saipen/` folder, and start writing a list of tasks (tickets). Bam, the patient is on the hook.

**Step 3. Make it work**
- You type `/saipen continue` РІР‚вЂќ the agent shuts up, reads what it planned, picks the top task, and does it.
- The next day, you open a completely blank chat, type `/saipen continue` again РІР‚вЂќ it picks up the old notes from the folder and resumes exactly where it stopped.

And if you need it to permanently remember that you only use Tabs and not Spaces РІР‚вЂќ toss a text file into `.saipen/KNOWLEDGE/`. It will read it like the Ten Commandments before every single task.

**Step 4. Evolution (for lazy asses)**
Board empty? Bored? Type `/saipen`.
Agent won't whine 'how can I help?'. It jumps to **HUNT**, seeks bugs. No bugs? Hits **ADD** and builds a new feature by strict rules: zero hardcoding, bulletproof persistence, user controls everything. You just sit, smoke, watch the app grow muscles itself.

Any questions? No? Then get back to work.
