# SAIPEN

**v7.2.0** | [Spec](SPEC.md) | [Guide](GUIDE.md) | plain markdown | zero deps | MIT

**One command. Zero amnesia.**

**Не объясняй ничего. Просто напиши saipen и продолжи работу над проектом как ни в чём не бывало, любым агентом.**

SAIPEN guarantees that any compatible AI agent can safely continue any project without being rebriefed.

SAIPEN is a stable, vendor-neutral continuation protocol. Its sole purpose is to ensure that a completely cold agent with zero chat history can execute `/saipen continue` and resume productive work within one minute, without asking the user to repeat context.

```text
User  ->  /saipen continue
Agent ->  reads STATE ("What do I do right now?")
Agent ->  reads BOARD ("What task am I picking up?")
Agent ->  reads next_action (executes command)
Agent ->  Works.
```

Instead of writing a README instructing models "how to behave", you drop SAIPEN into your project. Whether you use Claude today and Gemini tomorrow, both agents will instantly negotiate capabilities, follow the state machine, and execute the next action.

### Core Philosophy: Project State > Model Memory
Memory should live next to the code, not inside the head of another model. SAIPEN shifts the paradigm from `Project -> Memory -> LLM` to `Project -> SAIPEN State -> LLM`. The memory belongs to the project.

## The ABI for AI Agents (Compatibility Layer)

SAIPEN consists of two independent layers.

| Layer | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | ✅ | Continue work safely (the continuation protocol) |
| **Maintenance** | Built on top of Core | Improve software autonomously (continuous evolution) |

### Automated Continuous Evolution
When your project has no active tasks, just type `/saipen`. The protocol automatically triggers:
1. **HUNT**: A deep audit for bugs, failing tests, and dead code.
2. **ADD**: If no bugs remain, SAIPEN enters ADD and searches for the next obvious missing capability that naturally completes the product. The agent MUST prefer industry-standard functionality, UX completeness, and feature symmetry over novelty. Every addition MUST pass full verification before another HUNT begins. If the software is already mature, the agent gracefully stops.

It never spins its wheels. It just safely evolves your app step-by-step without you lifting a finger.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

**1. Install Globally (Once per machine)**
Inject the protocol into your agents (Claude Code, Gemini, OpenCode, Aider, Antigravity):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vacterro/saipen
cd saipen
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\bootstrap\inject.ps1     # Windows
bash bootstrap/inject.sh                                            # macOS / Linux
```

**2. Start a Project**
Open an agent in your project folder and type:
> `saipen SET` (or `saipen INIT`)

No install? Paste one line to your agent:
> Read <clone>/saipen/RFC.md + <clone>/saipen/STYLE.md and follow them.

## Documentation
- **[SPEC.md](SPEC.md)**: The formal RFC specification. Read this if you are building extensions or agent frameworks.
- **[RFC.md](saipen/RFC.md)**: The brutal, machine-readable ruleset that agents execute.
- **[GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md)**: The human tutorial with examples.
