SAIPEN is a stable, vendor-neutral continuation protocol. Its sole purpose is to guarantee that a completely cold agent with zero chat history can execute `/saipen continue` and resume productive work within one minute, without asking the user to repeat context.

```text
User  ->  /saipen continue
Agent ->  reads STATE ("What do I do right now?")
Agent ->  reads BOARD ("What task am I picking up?")
Agent ->  reads next_action (executes command)
Agent ->  Works.
```

Instead of writing a README instructing models "how to behave", you drop SAIPEN into your project. Whether you use Claude today and Gemini tomorrow, both agents will instantly negotiate capabilities, follow the state machine, and execute the next action.

### Automated Continuous Evolution
When your project has no active tasks, just type `/saipen`. The protocol automatically triggers:
1. **HUNT**: A deep audit for bugs, failing tests, and dead code.
2. **ADD**: If the code is perfectly clean, the agent brainstorms and safely implements ONE missing core feature (focusing on state persistence, user control, and industry standards).

It never spins its wheels. It just safely evolves your app step-by-step without you lifting a finger.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

**1. Install Globally (Once per machine)**
Inject the protocol into your agents (Claude Code, Gemini, OpenCode, Aider, Antigravity):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vacterro/saipen
cd saipen
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\bootstrap\inject.ps1     # Windows
bash bootstrap/inject.sh                                            # macOS / Linux
```

**2. Start a Project**
Open an agent in your project folder and type:
> `saipen SET` (or `saipen INIT`)

No install? Paste one line to your agent:
> Read <clone>/saipen/RFC.md + <clone>/saipen/STYLE.md and follow them.
