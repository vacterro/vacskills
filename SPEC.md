# SAIPEN Specification

## Abstract
**Design Goal #1: A cold agent with zero chat history must be able to execute `/saipen continue` and resume productive work within one minute, without asking the user to repeat context.**

SAIPEN is a portable, file-backed continuation protocol for LLM agents. Implementations MAY vary. The on-disk contract MUST remain stable. Everything in this protocol exists to serve the Continuation Test.

- **`STATE`**: Exists to answer *"What do I do right now?"*
- **`BOARD`**: Exists to answer *"What task am I picking up?"*
- **`LOG`**: Exists to answer *"Why did we come to this point?"*
- **`KNOWLEDGE`**: Exists to answer *"What is the durable truth of this project?"*
- **`next_action`**: The heart of SAIPEN. It answers *"What exact command do I execute right this second to resume work?"*

## Architecture

The protocol is strictly normative. We explicitly separate the **Core Protocol** from **Adaptive Extensions**.

## Two-Way Capability Negotiation
Agents do not simply declare what they can do; the protocol demands what is required.
The project defines `requires: [filesystem, git, python]` in its state. The agent cross-references its host capabilities and locks into a `mode` (e.g., `full`, `read-only`).

## Graph-Based Event Logging
Logs in SAIPEN are not linear strings. They form an acyclic graph of decisions using Event IDs (`E-001`). This permits complex branching, agent merging, and precise audit trails.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
Transient event logs do not house permanent knowledge. SAIPEN mandates that structural architectural decisions are persisted as ADRs (e.g., `KNOWLEDGE/ADR-001-use-sqlite.md`).

## Concurrency & Distribution Boundaries
SAIPEN ensures state integrity via file-based claims (`owner`, `claim_time`) and sequential graphs (`LOG.md`). However, **SAIPEN is a state protocol, not a distributed consensus algorithm.**
- **Local/Shared Filesystem**: Conflict resolution relies on atomic filesystem writes ("first commit wins").
- **Networked/Distributed Environments**: If agents operate across disconnected machines without real-time file syncing, race conditions on `BOARD.md` claims will occur. In highly distributed setups, SAIPEN MUST remain immutable, but a thin **Coordinator/Server Layer** SHOULD be built *on top* of SAIPEN to broker atomic locks before pushing state to the agents.
