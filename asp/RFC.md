## 1. Normative Rules
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

- Agent MUST read `STATE.md`, `BOARD.md`, and tail of `LOG.md` before execution.
- Agent MUST NOT rely on chat context for project state.
- Agent MUST degrade capabilities if host tools are missing.

## 2. File Model
- **STATE.md**: MUST contain frontmatter: `phase`, `task`, `next_action`, `blocker`, `agent`, `updated`. `next_action` MUST be an immediately executable command.
- **BOARD.md**: MUST track `status` (TODO/DOING/DONE), `needs:` (dependencies), and `owner` (claims).
- **LOG.md**: Append-only event graph. MUST use Event IDs (`[E-001]`) and MAY use `parent_id` (`[parent: E-001]`).
- **KNOWLEDGE/**: Directory for durable truths. MUST NOT contain event histories. Uses ADR pattern (`ADR-001.md`).

## 3. State Machine Transitions
`INIT → PLAN → SCOUT → BUILD → VERIFY → REVIEW → SHIP → DONE | BLOCKED | HUNT | ADD`

**Strict Transition Constraints:**
- **VERIFY**: MUST be executed. Failure loops back to `BUILD` (max 2 loops) or `SCOUT`. Success transitions to `REVIEW`.
- **MANUAL-VERIFY**: If `mode: manual-verify`, `VERIFY` MUST block and await human confirmation. Agent MUST NOT auto-transition to `REVIEW`.
- **DONE**: A ticket MUST NOT be marked `DONE` without a successful `VERIFY` (or human `MANUAL-VERIFY`).
- **HUNT**: Transition to `HUNT` MUST occur strictly when `BOARD.md` has no open `TODO` tickets without blockers, or when explicitly signaled by a failed verification loop. Agent MUST NOT hallucinate tasks during `HUNT`.
- **ADD**: Transition to `ADD` occurs when instructed to brainstorm and implement new features based on core UX rules.
- **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**: If the user runs the protocol (e.g., `/asp` or `asp continue`) and `BOARD.md` is empty (no tickets), the agent MUST immediately transition to the `HUNT` phase to search for bugs. If `HUNT` finds nothing (clean), the agent MUST immediately transition to `ADD` to evolve the software.

## 4. Ticket Model (DAG)
- Tickets MUST define dependencies using `needs: [T-XXX]`.
- This is a strict Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Agents MUST NOT pick `TODO` tickets unless all `needs:` are marked `DONE`.

## 5. Claim / Ownership
- Agent sets `owner: <AgentID>` and `claim_time: <ISO8601>` on BOARD.
- Active owner: `claim_time` < 15 minutes old, or actively writing to `LOG.md`.
- Stale claims: `claim_time` > 15 minutes + no LOG activity → claim is forfeit.
- Conflicting writes: First successful filesystem commit wins.

## 6. Checkpointing
- MUST checkpoint after every ticket or before session termination.
- Update `BOARD.md`, set `STATE.md` explicit `next_action`, flush `LOG.md`. On-disk state MUST be atomic.

## 7. Recovery
- If `STATE.md` is stale but `LOG.md` or `BOARD.md` is newer, `git status` is ground truth.
- Rebuild `STATE.md` based on latest `LOG.md` entry and open DOING ticket.

## 8. Capability Negotiation (Two-Way Handshake)
1. **Protocol Demands**: `STATE.md` MAY define `requires: [filesystem, git, shell, python]`.
2. **Agent Capabilities**: Agent MUST evaluate host against requirements.
3. **Mode Lock**: Agent MUST write operating mode to `STATE.md` (`mode: full | read-only | no-publish | manual-verify`).
   - Missing Git: `mode: no-publish`. Agent MUST NOT transition to `SHIP`.
   - Missing Shell: `mode: manual-verify`.
   - Missing Filesystem Write: `mode: read-only`.

## 9. Workspace Hygiene
The protocol lives in the ASP home; the project holds work, not protocol copies.
- Protocol files (`RFC.md`, `STYLE.md`, `UI.md`, `SKILL.md`, `phases/`) MUST NOT be copied into the project. Agents read them from the ASP home; the pointer block in `AGENTS.md` gives the path.
- Project memory MUST live in `.asp/` under canonical names only: `STATE.md`, `BOARD.md`, `LOG.md`, `KNOWLEDGE/`. Ad-hoc names (`CONTEXT.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `NOTES.md`) are non-conformant — fold their content into the canonical file (`CONTEXT` → `KNOWLEDGE/`, `MEMORY` → `LOG.md`) and delete the stray.
- Every `.md` MUST earn its place: one purpose, no duplication, no filler. On checkpoint, agent MUST prune generated litter (`__pycache__`, editor swaps, empty scaffold files) and MUST NOT create a file it will not maintain.
- Deliverables (client-facing outputs) live at project root and are exempt; they are work, not protocol.
