# Changelog

## 7.5.0 -- 2026-07-19
- feat (field audit, three live projects): checked how real agents actually use SAIPEN in practice (FastPrompter, Wintage, WildRiftAssistant) instead of only auditing the protocol in isolation. Found the LOG.md line format has zero real-world consensus -- three projects, three different formats, none matching STYLE.md's own example: FastPrompter uses `[E-001] DATE — LABEL:` (ID before date, no leading dash); Wintage uses phase names (`SCOUT:`/`BUILD:`) instead of a taxonomy; WildRiftAssistant has ZERO numeric Event IDs across all 85 LOG lines (uses `[HUNT]`/`[FIX]`/`[GOAL]` instead) and a literal `XX` placeholder for minutes in 57 separate entries. Root cause: the LOG line's structural skeleton lived only in STYLE.md (a voice/personality doc agents can reasonably deprioritize), not in RFC.md (always-loaded, strictly normative) -- and STYLE.md's own example didn't even include the `[E-###]` RFC already requires. RFC.md § 1.2 now states the exact skeleton (`- DATE [E-###] [parent: E-###] [T-###] TAXONOMY: text`) as MUST, with `RUN`/`DEC`/`H` as the closed, explicitly-named taxonomy (never declared as a closed set anywhere before this). STYLE.md's example fixed to match instead of contradict.
- fix: `phases/init.md` pointed at a `templates/` path that has never existed (the real path is `extensions/templates/`) and its own inline LOG example (`[E-001] DEC: Initialize SAIPEN`) violated the format it was teaching -- every fresh project's first log line was non-conformant by instruction. Also `extensions/templates/STATE.md` itself was missing `saipen_version`, `schema_version`, and `goal_mode` despite `init.md` listing them as MUST. All three reconciled; "or write manually" softened to a genuine fallback (degraded capability only), not an equally-valid default.
- Note: the three live projects' own existing `.saipen/LOG.md` history was NOT touched -- that's the user's active work under other agents' hands, not this repo's to rewrite. The fix is forward-looking: once each project's agent re-reads the refreshed protocol, new entries should conform.

## 7.4.6 -- 2026-07-19
- fix (the conformance suite was silently lying): explored `CONFORMANCE.md`, `extensions/`, and `tests/` for the first time this session and found `tests/validate.sh`/`validate.ps1` badly out of sync with the live protocol. (1) The `phase:` whitelist was missing `HUNT`, `ADD`, `CLEAN`, `TRANSLATE` entirely -- a validate run during any Maintenance phase would false-fail. (2) The LOG.md regex required `[E-###]` immediately after the dash with zero tolerance for the date prefix STYLE.md has mandated all along -- empirically, 0 of 34 correctly-dated lines in this repo's own `.saipen/LOG.md` matched it. (3) `validate.sh`'s check used `grep -q` (succeeds on ANY matching line) instead of verifying no line violates -- it was passing only because 124 leftover lines from an old un-dated import happened to satisfy the stale pattern, masking that literally none of today's real entries would. Fixed both scripts: phase whitelist completed, date prefix made optional-but-recognized, bash's any-match logic replaced with a real all-lines check (and its own `set -e` trap on a legitimately-empty `grep -v` result fixed along the way). Verified empirically -- both scripts now genuinely pass against this repo's real `.saipen/`, not by accident.
- fix: traced the false-pass to its root -- `phases/clean.md` never specified an exact LOG line format (same class of gap already fixed in `hunt.md`/`translate.md`), so a past agent invented a non-conformant `[E-CLEAN]` marker instead of a normal numbered Event ID. `clean.md` now specifies the exact format. The one historical `[E-CLEAN]` line was reformatted to a real `[E-115]` entry -- content and timestamp preserved, only the broken format corrected (not a content rewrite).
- fix: three `tests/scenarios/*/STATE.md` fixtures opened frontmatter with `--` instead of `---`. Harmless to the validators (they don't check delimiters) but objectively wrong YAML syntax; corrected for consistency.

## 7.4.5 -- 2026-07-19
- fix (the significant one): `phases/verify.md`'s cap said only "-> BLOCKED + facts" with no instruction to try other tickets first, and `phases/blocked.md` went straight to "ask the user, wait" with no check for remaining work -- combined with §2.4 treating any BLOCKED as a goal_mode-exit condition, one stuck ticket could halt an entire autonomous run even with five perfectly workable tickets still on the board. `verify.md` now marks only the stuck ticket blocked and moves to the next unblocked one; `blocked.md` (session-level, last resort) now re-checks the board before ever asking the user. `review.md`'s own "NO -- BLOCKER" cap was checked and is unaffected -- it already tickets the stubborn finding and continues, no fix needed there.
- fix: `phases/init.md` still wrote `asp_version: 7` into fresh `STATE.md` -- the one surviving leftover of the pre-rename protocol name, everywhere else (including this repo's own `.saipen/STATE.md`) uses `saipen_version`. Every newly bootstrapped project was getting an inconsistent schema from day one.
- fix: RFC.md §1.8's "strictly one by one" was ambiguous between BUILD scope (intended: don't mix tickets in one edit) and cadence (misreadable as: pause after each ticket) -- the latter reading directly contradicts `goal_mode`'s continuous-flow guarantee. Clarified explicitly.

## 7.4.4 -- 2026-07-19
- fix: Audited another agent's unreviewed commits to this repo (§1.8 Batch Input Parsing, Zero-Prompt Auto-Transition, TRANSLATE phase, ADD baseline constraints -- f709eed/57cb87f/a463be2, all confirmed sound). Found and fixed three real gaps in the new `phases/translate.md`: (1) "the kitchen" was ambiguous against §1.2's single `kitchen/` definition and contradicted the phase's own isolation rule -- `.saitranslate/kitchen/` is now explicit and cross-referenced from RFC.md §1.2; (2) "drawn flag icon" assumed image-generation tooling most text agents don't have -- Unicode flag emoji is now the stated universal baseline; (3) completion LOG line was free-text, tightened to the same exact-format convention as `hunt.md`. Also restructured `add.md`: Baseline Architectural Constraints (session persistence, no hardcoding) were nested inside the Industrial Completion Rule's bullet list despite being a distinct, always-applicable concern -- now its own numbered item.

## 7.4.3 -- 2026-07-19
- docs: README trimmed 79 -> 65 lines -- cut redundant/flavor prose (two intro paragraphs saying the same thing twice, decorative asides in the Evolution section), kept every fact intact (GOAL Mode safety valve, auto-push scope, VERIFY/REVIEW guarantee, install commands). Also fixed a stale version badge (was still showing v7.2.0).

## 7.4.2 -- 2026-07-19
- docs: Renamed "Optional acceleration" to "Optional Parallel Execution" in RFC.md §1.3 -- independence of the 6 HUNT categories is the trigger, speed is only the consequence. SPEC.md's Architecture section now states the verified layer independence explicitly: Core (correctness/continuation) works with zero Maintenance; Maintenance (unattended evolution) works identically with or without Goal Mode; Goal Mode and Subagents are both confirmed opt-in with no downstream dependency pointing back at them.

## 7.4.1 -- 2026-07-19
- fix: `phases/ship.md`'s terminal line ("After SHIP: STATE -> DONE") had zero mention of `goal_mode`, the same class of gap fixed in `done.md`/`review.md` a version ago -- a model landing here in one continuous turn could write `phase: DONE` without ever loading `done.md`'s goal_mode check in the same pass. Now checks explicitly. Full sweep of every other `DONE` transition in `phases/*.md` confirmed clean: `add.md`'s is the one legitimate exit condition (product mature) RFC §2.4 already defers to, and `clean.md` is purely human-triggered, already covered by `done.md`'s landing check.

## 7.4.0 -- 2026-07-19
- feat: `HUNT` fans its 6 independent signal categories out to parallel subagents when the platform supports spawning them (RFC.md §1.3, new optional `subagents` capability -- never required, never gates a phase). Subagents are read-only investigators; only the orchestrating agent writes BOARD/LOG, once, after merging results, avoiding write races by construction. No subagent support falls back silently to the existing sequential sweep -- identical cap, identical output, just slower.

## 7.3.3 -- 2026-07-19
- fix (root cause, found via a second WildRiftAssistant trace on the SAME bug after 7.3.2): `phases/done.md` item 3's HUNT-trigger condition was "the user simply typed `/saipen`" -- literally false when an agent arrives at DONE autonomously mid-`goal_mode` run, since the user typed nothing. A model reading `done.md` correctly would NOT transition to HUNT under that wording, no matter how clearly RFC.md §2.4 said to elsewhere. `done.md` now checks `goal_mode` FIRST, before any other branch, and forbids writing `next_action: wait for user command` while it's true.
- fix: `phases/review.md` had no "STATE -> DONE" branch at all, yet the observed trace jumped straight to DONE past the mandatory SHIP step. Added an explicit line: SHIP is mandatory before DONE, no exceptions, even under `goal_mode`.

## 7.3.2 -- 2026-07-19
- fix: Lowercased every command everywhere -- `saipen set`, `saipen goal`, `saipen init` (was inconsistently ALL-CAPS in RFC/README/guides/skill/injector). No functional change from casing.
- fix (real bug, found via a live WildRiftAssistant trace): Goal Mode's Exit clause let a momentarily empty `BOARD.md` count as "reached DONE," short-circuiting the mandatory HUNT->ADD Autonomous Transition (RFC.md §2.1) and stranding the agent at `next_action: wait for user command` instead of looping. RFC.md §2.4 now states explicitly: board-empty is a waypoint, not an exit; `goal_mode` persists through HUNT->ADD->HUNT->ADD until ADD itself gracefully concludes (product mature), BLOCKED, or the safety valve (3 waves/20 tickets) triggers. `phases/hunt.md` reinforced: the clean-hunt-to-ADD transition is unconditional and the LOG line format is exact, not free text.

## 7.3.1 -- 2026-07-18
- fix: Merged `saipen GOAL <text>` with the pre-existing (undocumented-in-RFC) "pivot" semantics already promised in the guides -- entering GOAL mode now demotes (never deletes) the current board and inserts the new objective's tickets on top, before running them to completion. Normalized casing to `saipen GOAL` everywhere (was inconsistently `goal` in RFC/phases/README, matching the pre-existing `saipen SET` convention). Updated README, GUIDE.md, GUIDE_EN.md, GUIDE_RU.md to describe the full merged behavior.

## 7.3.0 -- 2026-07-18
- feat: Introduced `saipen goal <text>` (RFC.md §2.4) -- an explicit, session-scoped autonomous mode that runs SCOUT->BUILD->VERIFY->REVIEW across successive tickets and waves without pausing to ask "shall I continue?". SHIP auto-pushes to an existing `origin` under `goal_mode`; first publish of a brand-new repository still requires explicit confirmation. VERIFY and REVIEW gates, and all existing caps (3 dead hypotheses / 2 fix cycles / 2 review passes), are never skipped. New safety valve: max 3 waves / 20 tickets per invocation before a mandatory checkpoint-and-report.

## 7.2.1 -- 2026-07-18
- docs: Refined the Industrial Completion Rule (`RFC.md` §2.3, `phases/add.md`). Replaced "functional cluster" with "user workflow" throughout for a clearer mental model. Added the "Complete before you extend" maxim: finish the requested workflow before proposing a different one, because agents should preserve user expectations before introducing new capabilities.

## 7.2.0 -- 2026-07-18
- feat: Introduced the `ADD` phase. The agent now acts as a product manager and lead engineer to systematically brainstorm and implement new features based on core UX rules (persistence, industry standards, maximum user control, safe step-by-step evolution).
- feat: Automated Continuous Evolution. When `BOARD.md` is empty, `/saipen` defaults to the `HUNT` phase to fix bugs. If `HUNT` finds a clean codebase, it automatically transitions to the `ADD` phase to safely evolve the software.
- doc: Added ELI5 "Grandpa Style" guides (`GUIDE_RU.md`, `GUIDE_EN.md`) and linked them with prominent shields.io badges in the `README.md`.
- fix: Replaced `inject.ps1` and `inject.sh` symlink (junction) creation with direct file copies to ensure maximum reliability across all agent platforms.
- fix: Restored Cyrillic UTF-8 encoding in `STYLE.md` to ensure correct persona injection for future agents.

## 7.1.2 -- 2026-07-17
- refactor: Renamed GitHub repository from `vacskill` to `saipen`. Updated all absolute URLs and git clone instructions.

## 7.1.1 -- 2026-07-17
- doc: Formally defined the boundary of SAIPEN regarding distributed consensus. SAIPEN explicitly states it is a local state protocol relying on atomic filesystem commits; true multi-machine network distribution requires an external "Coordinator" built on top of SAIPEN.

## 7.1.0 -- 2026-07-17
- refactor: Total Bootstrap Decoupling. Stripped all remaining platform-specific instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `VACSKILL:BEGIN`) from the `init.md` core phase. The core is now perfectly sterile and only initializes the `.saipen/` directory.
- chore: Replaced all legacy `VACSKILL:BEGIN` hooks with `SAIPEN:BEGIN` inside the bootstrap scripts.

## 7.0.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING / REWRITE: `PROTOCOL.md` has been brutally minimized (< 60 lines). 
- doc: Removed Abstract, Scope, Adapter Contract, and CLI commands from the core protocol machine document. These have been migrated to `SPEC.md` and `GUIDE.md` to prevent any context distraction.
- feat: `DONE` phase formally forbidden without successful `VERIFY` (or `MANUAL-VERIFY`), `needs` formalized as strict DAG, and `HUNT` signal dependency rigidly enforced.

## 6.3.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING / REWRITE: `PROTOCOL.md` has been brutally minimized (< 60 lines). 
- doc: Removed Abstract, Scope, Adapter Contract, and CLI commands from the core protocol machine document. These have been migrated to `SPEC.md` and `GUIDE.md` to prevent any context distraction.
- feat: `DONE` phase formally forbidden without successful `VERIFY` (or `MANUAL-VERIFY`), `needs` formalized as strict DAG, and `HUNT` signal dependency rigidly enforced.

## 6.2.0 -- 2026-07-17
- refactor: Ruthlessly purged all conversational/literary explanations from `PROTOCOL.md` to ensure the machine document remains absolutely cold and unambiguous.
- feat: Formalized Conformance into three strict vectors: Repo Validation, Session Validation, and Phase Contract Validation. `saipen validate` is now structurally mandated to enforce these vectors.

## 6.1.0 -- 2026-07-17
- doc: Reframed SAIPEN completely around the **"Continuation Test"**. Memory is a means to an end; instant action is the goal. Tagline changed to "One command. Zero amnesia."
- feat: Added `TEST-001: The Continuation Test` to the Conformance section as the gold standard for release validation.
- feat: `next_action` in `STATE.md` MUST now be an explicitly executable command (e.g. `pytest tests/`), not a vague intent, to ensure zero-context resumption.

## 6.0.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING / REBRAND: Renamed "Cross-Agent Project Memory Protocol" to **SAIPEN**.
- BREAKING: `LOG.md` events are no longer linear lists. They are now graph nodes identified by `[E-XXX]` and `[parent: E-XXX]`, enabling safe multi-agent branching and merges.
- feat: Implemented Two-Way Capability Negotiation. The protocol now dictates `requires:` in `STATE.md`, and the agent locks its `mode:` based on local capabilities.
- feat: Formalized Architecture Decision Records (ADR). Long-term truths live in `KNOWLEDGE/ADR-XXX.md` to prevent log bloat.
- feat: Expanded `extensions/` architecture with `security/` and `performance/` hook documentation.
- doc: Radically split documentation. `README.md` is now just a 5-minute pitch. `SPEC.md` is the human-readable RFC. `PROTOCOL.md` is strictly machine instructions. `GUIDE.md` is the human tutorial.

## 5.3.0 -- 2026-07-17
- feat: Added dedicated `validate` phase and `saipen validate` command.
- feat: Added `tests/validate.ps1` and `tests/validate.sh` conformance checker scripts.
- test: Added `tests/scenarios/` with 7 mock `.saipen` states for protocol compliance testing (crash-recovery, staleness, claim conflicts).
- struct: Explicitly separated Core (`saipen/`) from Adaptive Extensions (`extensions/` schemas, adapters, templates) to prevent protocol pollution.

## 5.2.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING / REWRITE: Converted the core `PROTOCOL.md` from a conversational guide into a strict, RFC-style normative specification.
- feat: Formalized the State Machine (`INIT РІвЂ вЂ™ PLAN РІвЂ вЂ™ SCOUT РІвЂ вЂ™ BUILD РІвЂ вЂ™ VERIFY РІвЂ вЂ™ REVIEW РІвЂ вЂ™ SHIP РІвЂ вЂ™ DONE | BLOCKED`).
- feat: Formalized Claim/Ownership logic (`owner` and `claim_time` added to `board.schema.json`) to prevent multi-agent race conditions.
- feat: Added Capability Negotiation handshake (agents MUST check capabilities like git/shell before engaging).
- feat: Added formal Recovery doctrine.
- doc: Stripped all "marketing copy" and persona out of `PROTOCOL.md` into non-normative abstracts, reinforcing that voice (`STYLE.md`) never overrides logic.

## 5.1.0 -- 2026-07-17
- feat: unified "Р Т‘Р ВµР Т‘ РЎРѓ РЎР‚Р В°Р в„–Р С•Р Р…Р В°" persona. Removed haiku requirement completely. The direct, witty, tough-love "grandpa" style is now the default for both chat responses and LOG entries (while maintaining strict caveman token compression and preserving facts verbatim).

## 5.0.1 -- 2026-07-17
- fix: extract missing `verify.md`, `review.md`, `done.md`, and `blocked.md` phases that were unintentionally merged or omitted in 5.0.0, which broke lazy loading when STATE entered these phases

## 5.0.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING: 2-tier protocol architecture. PROTOCOL.md is now a dense boot loader (~110 lines, ~1,200 tokens cold start). Phase-specific rules moved to lazy-loaded saipen/phases/ modules (init, plan, scout, build, ship, hunt). Agent loads only the phase it needs -- 60% fewer tokens per session vs monolithic v4. All rules preserved, zero lost. README rewritten for SAIPEN positioning
## 4.1.0 -- 2026-07-17
- Public launch edition: fix encoding corruption throughout (control chars -> clean ASCII, no BOM anywhere); README rewritten for public consumption with clean ASCII art; PROTOCOL.md audited and rebuilt clean

## 4.0.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING: skill -> protocol. saipen/PROTOCOL.md is the single vendor-neutral canon (240 lines, capability degradation table included); SKILL.md shrunk to a thin skill-reader adapter. New: adapters/ (9 platforms), templates/ (init boilerplate), style/ (opt-in voices), schemas/ frozen for a future orchestrator. Injectors point everything at PROTOCOL.md, upgrade stale 3.x blocks, and write UTF-8 without BOM. Positioning: vendor-neutral project execution protocol for LLM agents

## 3.1.2 -- 2026-07-16
- hotfix: ensure FreeBuff and Antigravity plugins receive copy, not junction, as their scanners ignore symlinks

## 3.1.1 -- 2026-07-15
- core reliability audit: HUNT skip was a phantom rule since 2.0.0 (no clean-line format, no anchor) -- now `hunt -> clean @<hash>` vs HEAD; legacy rename no longer assumes git; STYLE.md-missing fallback; REVIEW pass counter lives in LOG not memory; graph-mode claim race resolved by re-read; history prune made explicit. Net zero lines -- fixes paid for by compression

## 3.1.0a -- 2026-07-15
- drop _archive_versions/ -- identical twins of v1.2.2, already served by tags (`git show v1.2.2:VAC/SKILL.md`)

## 3.1.0 -- 2026-07-15
- anti-drift: STYLE.md Persistence section (voice holds every response, no revert after many turns) + protocol loads it upfront; git tags as release archive (all 17 past versions tagged retroactively); memory backup rule for non-git projects; self-imposed ~250-line cap -- SKILL.md compressed 281 -> 249 with zero rules lost

## 3.0.0 -- 2026-07-15
- BREAKING: renamed VAC -> saipen everywhere -- skill name, folder, memory dir (.vac/ -> .saipen/), pointer blocks (VACSKILL:BEGIN), repo (github.com/vacterro/saipen). Short alias `vac` still works for every command. Injector migrates pre-3.0 installs automatically; in projects run `git mv .vac .saipen`

## 2.1.0a -- 2026-07-15
- README rewritten for v2.x: angrier grandpa, phases/confidence/graph/KNOWLEDGE covered

## 2.1.0 -- 2026-07-15
- verify confidence (high/med/low) on DONE tickets; graph mode: parallel agents claim [P] tickets over needs: DAG; KNOWLEDGE index.md rule; vac status quick metrics

## 2.0.0 -- 2026-07-15
- protocol/personality split: SKILL.md cold protocol + new STYLE.md (voices); SCOUT and REVIEW promoted to phases (PLAN->SCOUT->BUILD->VERIFY->REVIEW->SHIP); KNOWLEDGE/ base (architecture/conventions/decisions/traps) -- LOG is journal only; BOARD needs: dependencies + no-free-will pick rule; minimal STATE

## 1.2.2 -- 2026-07-15
- injectors detect generic ~/.agents/skills (FreeBuff etc.); fixed broken-encoding stale copy there

## 1.2.1 -- 2026-07-15
- README rewritten: caveman English voice, ELI5 usage guide, half the size, twice the punch

## 1.2.0 -- 2026-07-15
- one-shot injectors inject.ps1 + inject.sh: auto-detect and wire all agentic systems (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity plugins, Aider), idempotent re-runs

## 1.1.5 -- 2026-07-15
- chat voice: compressed, direct, no filler; LOG persona unchanged

## 1.1.4a -- 2026-07-15
- voice boundaries hardened: LOG voice confined to .vac/ files only; chat strictly direct

## 1.1.4 -- 2026-07-15
- human dates DD.MM.YY HH:mm in LOG, wise-angry-grandpa commentary voice (facts stay exact), closing haiku on stop/ship; chat voice unchanged

## 1.1.3 -- 2026-07-15
- self-cleaning: scratch confined to .vac/tmp/ (deleted at stop/ship), orphan-file hunting with proven-unreferenced guard, no-litter iron rule

## 1.1.2 -- 2026-07-15
- publish target now user-agnostic: repo's own origin / logged-in gh account -- no hardcoded owner

## 1.1.1 -- 2026-07-15
- concurrent-agent takeover guard; new-machine bootstrap fallback in pointer block; .gitignore/.env guard before publish commits

## 1.1.0a -- 2026-07-15
- add "vac set" as official resume alias

## 1.1.0 -- 2026-07-15
- loop caps (3 hypotheses / 2 fix cycles -> BLOCKED, never spin); PUBLISH opt-in only (no auto-push of user projects); HUNT skips unchanged-clean repos; runtime token discipline section; unified checkpoint doctrine

## 1.0.1 -- 2026-07-15
- portable install: clone-anywhere paths, macOS/Linux symlinks; MIT LICENSE; SKILL.md init block uses <VAC_HOME> instead of hardcoded path

## 1.0.0 -- 2026-07-15
- first release: single VAC skill (PLAN/BUILD/CHECK/SHIP/HUNT loop), .vac/ cross-agent memory, ship-to-GitHub flow
