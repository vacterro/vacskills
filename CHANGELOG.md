# Changelog

## 7.7.1 -- 2026-07-20 -- final control review
- fix (real RFC-2119 self-contradiction): § 2.3 The Industrial Completion Rule said "the agent SHOULD implement the minimal coherent set" in its opening paragraph, then two lines later said "The agent MUST complete the minimal coherent set" for the exact same obligation -- SHOULD and MUST have meaningfully different force under the RFC 2119 keywords this document itself invokes (§ 1.1). Resolved by splitting what was actually two distinct obligations conflated into one: whether the rule applies is a judgment call (stays SHOULD), but once triggered, implementing it is a discipline requirement (now MUST, matching the smallest-complete-solution bullet). `phases/add.md`'s parallel wording had the same clauses inverted (MUST evaluate, MUST implement) -- aligned to match: SHOULD evaluate, MUST implement.
- fix: § 1.2's `## BLOCKED` bullet cited "§ VERIFY debug cap" -- malformed, `§` denotes a numbered RFC section and VERIFY's debug cap isn't one (it lives in `phases/verify.md`). Fixed to cite the file directly, no more phantom section number.
- fix: "the Pick Rule" was cited by name in § 1.2 (`## BLOCKED` bullet) and has been used in chat throughout this session, but § 1.6 -- the section actually being cited -- never named it; it only described the behavior inline. Formally bolded as **Pick Rule** at its point of definition in § 1.6 so the cross-reference resolves to a real term instead of an inference.
- fix: § 1.10's citation for `saipen continue` / bare `saipen` pointed only at § 1.1 (general read requirement) and missed § 2.1's DEFAULT BEHAVIOR bullet, which is the actual normative definition of what the bare command does. Added.
- fix: `.gitattributes` had only a bare `* text=auto` with no per-type override. Added `*.sh text eol=lf` as defensive hardening for the bash scripts this project ships and depends on running correctly on macOS/Linux -- verified against the actual git blobs that current line endings were already clean LF (no corruption existed; this is prevention, not a fix for existing damage).
- fix: `.gitignore` still carried `.asp/tmp/`, `.asp/history/`, `.vac/tmp/` -- dead patterns for directory names nothing in the current SAIPEN naming scheme has created since the vacskill/ASP-era rename. Removed; only `.saipen/` and its `kitchen/` subdirectory exist today, and `kitchen/` is intentionally NOT gitignored (RFC § 1.2: a successor agent MUST be able to inspect it after a clone, so it needs to stay tracked).
- removed: `style/` (`default.md`, `grandpa.md`, `concise.md`, `corporate.md`) -- a designed-but-orphaned mechanism for switching the chat voice mid-session (`style corporate`, `style concise`, etc.). Zero references anywhere in the live protocol tree (RFC.md, STYLE.md, SKILL.md) -- an agent had no way to discover it existed, and two of the four files carried the same mojibake corruption fixed elsewhere this cycle. STYLE.md has since consolidated on a single caveman+dedy voice as SAIPEN's identity, not a menu of swappable personas, so this wasn't a gap to wire up -- confirmed dead code (HUNT signal #6) and removed with the user's explicit sign-off rather than assumed unilaterally.
- Verified: both validators pass, full repo-wide BOM sweep (every tracked file, not just ones touched this session) found zero BOM anywhere, git tags/VERSION/CHANGELOG head all agree at every step.

## 7.7.0 -- 2026-07-20
- feat: found the same phantom-command bug class as the `saipen fix` fix, except worse -- `saipen status` and `saipen stop` are two of the six commands in GUIDE.md/GUIDE_EN.md/GUIDE_RU.md's primary user-facing command table, each with clear, specific promised behavior ("read-only report", "checkpoint and hand control back"), and neither has ever had a single line of backing definition in RFC.md or any `phases/*.md`. An agent reading only the actual protocol tree (not GUIDE.md, which it has no obligation to load) would have nothing to go on if a user typed either.
- feat: new RFC.md § 1.10 Command Surface. Formalizes `status` (read-only, MUST NOT write or perform work, even under `goal_mode`) and `stop` (immediate § 1.5 checkpoint, then halt -- overrides `goal_mode`, the user's manual brake always wins) as normative MUST behavior matching what GUIDE.md already promised. Also lists every other recognized command with a cross-reference to where it's actually defined, turning this into a registry -- closes the whole bug class, not just these two instances, since any future `phases/*.md` doc inventing an undefined command now has an explicit place it should have been declared and wasn't.
- Verified: both validators still pass, RFC.md non-ASCII sweep confirmed clean (only legitimate UTF-8 `§`, no mojibake), no BOM.

## 7.6.1 -- 2026-07-20
- fix: `phases/done.md` item 3 told agents to run `saipen fix SYMPTOM` -- a command that doesn't exist anywhere else in the protocol. Not in RFC.md, not in GUIDE.md's command table, not in SKILL.md. The correct entry point per RFC § 2.4 is bare `saipen <text>`; done.md now says that instead of a phantom subcommand.
- fix: `phases/validate.md`'s own summary of the "three conformance vectors" had drifted from `CONFORMANCE.md`'s wording (itself just fixed in v7.6.0) and used the ambiguous word "schema" again -- exactly the term v7.6.0 had to disambiguate. Also neither doc previously listed `KNOWLEDGE/` as part of Repo Validation despite both validators actually checking it as a fourth vector. Both docs now say the same thing, matching what the scripts do.
- fix: `phases/clean.md`'s Board Scrub step never mentioned the `## BLOCKED` section added in v7.6.0 -- a gap CLEAN itself created a precondition for. CLEAN now re-checks every `## BLOCKED` ticket: blocker resolved elsewhere -> back to `## TODO`; still stuck and abandoned -> pruned like a stale `TODO`. `## BLOCKED` was at risk of becoming a graveyard nothing ever revisits.
- fix: `SPEC.md`'s architecture tree listed `verify.md` under "Maintenance Phases" -- wrong, VERIFY sits directly in the Core ticket DAG (RFC § 1.6: `BUILD -> VERIFY -> REVIEW`), every ticket passes through it, it has nothing to do with autonomous HUNT/ADD/CLEAN evolution. Moved to Core Phases where build.md/review.md already are. Also reworded the `schemas/` tree entry from "canonical file schemas" to "reference file schemas (not machine-enforced)" to stop contradicting the v7.6.0 CONFORMANCE.md fix, and noted RFC § 1.9 on the `security/`/`performance/` entries now that they're actually discoverable.
- fix: `README.md`'s version badge had drifted to `v7.4.2` (real version several ships ahead at time of fix: `v7.6.0`) -- `phases/ship.md` step 1 already says the README's version must be current, this was pure execution drift across several ships, not a spec gap. Corrected; watch this going forward, it has now drifted twice.

## 7.6.0 -- 2026-07-20
- feat: new RFC.md § 1.9 Extension Discovery. `extensions/security/` and `extensions/performance/` both said "MUST read this directory" for VERIFY/REVIEW respectively, but nothing in the always/on-demand-loaded protocol tree (RFC.md, `phases/verify.md`, `phases/review.md`) ever told an agent these hook points existed -- a completely undiscoverable "MUST". § 1.9 now states the general extension-discovery rule (check `extensions/<name>/` on entering its stated phase; absent = zero overhead, never gates a transition), and `verify.md`/`review.md` each gained one concrete line pointing at their respective extension. `extensions/schemas/` is carved out explicitly as the one non-behavioral exception (see below).
- feat: resolved the long-standing "how exactly is a blocked ticket marked" gap. `BOARD.md` gains a fourth section, `## BLOCKED`, alongside `## DOING`/`## TODO`/`## DONE` -- distinct from session-level `STATE.phase: BLOCKED`. `phases/verify.md`'s debug cap now says concretely "move THIS ticket to the `## BLOCKED` section" instead of the previously vague "mark THIS ticket blocked". The Pick Rule already only ever selects from `## TODO`, so a blocked ticket is excluded automatically, no extra filtering logic needed anywhere. Applied to `extensions/templates/BOARD.md`, this repo's own `.saipen/BOARD.md`, `phases/init.md`'s bootstrap skeleton, and `board.schema.json` (new `BLOCKED` enum value + `blocker` field). Also fixed three `tests/scenarios/*/.saipen/BOARD.md` fixtures (blocked-ticket, stale-state-reconciliation, multi-agent-claim-conflict) that had bare checkbox lines with no section headings at all -- didn't match the canonical format they were supposed to demonstrate.
- fix: `CONFORMANCE.md` flatly contradicted `extensions/schemas/README.md`. CONFORMANCE claimed "STATE/BOARD/LOG MUST conform to extensions/schemas/" as a normative MUST; the schemas' own README says "no agent reads these... frozen until an orchestrator exists" -- confirmed true by grepping `tests/validate.sh`/`validate.ps1`, which check shapes via plain regex against the Markdown files directly and never touch the JSON schemas at all. CONFORMANCE.md now correctly points at RFC.md § 1.2 (enforced by the validators) and describes the schemas as a forward-looking, not-yet-enforced reference.
- fix: all three `extensions/schemas/*.json` files still had `"title": "VAC ... Schema"` (pre-rename leftover). `state.schema.json`'s `phase` enum was missing `INIT`/`HUNT`/`ADD`/`CLEAN`/`TRANSLATE`/`VALIDATE` and had no `goal_mode` property at all despite it being a documented RFC field. All synced to current reality -- title, phase enum, `goal_mode`, and (see above) the new `BLOCKED` board status. Verified all three still parse as valid JSON after editing.
- fix: mojibake em-dash in `extensions/schemas/README.md` (same corruption class as v7.5.1/7.5.2), cleaned in place.
- Both `tests/validate.sh` and `validate.ps1` re-run against this repo's own `.saipen/` after every edit in this batch -- still pass throughout, including after the `## BLOCKED` heading addition (the cycle-detection regex is heading-agnostic, confirmed rather than assumed).

## 7.5.2 -- 2026-07-20
- fix (real bug, not cosmetic): `bootstrap/inject.ps1` and `inject.sh` were never actually idempotent despite both claiming it in their own header comments. `Remove-LegacyBlock`/`strip_legacy_block` unconditionally stripped ANY `<!-- SAIPEN:BEGIN -->` block -- including a perfectly current, already-installed one -- before `Add-Block`/`add_block` ever got a chance to check "is this already installed". That made the "already"/"upgraded" branch permanently dead code: every single re-run silently stripped and rewrote every target file (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`) and reported it as `"migrated from VAC"`, forever, even on a machine that has never seen VAC. The bash version had a second, independent instance of the same root problem: `strip_legacy_block` always returned success regardless of whether it matched anything, so even a brand-new file being created for the first time got mislabeled `"migrated from VAC"` too.
- fix: both scripts now compare the existing `SAIPEN:BEGIN...END` block's content against the canonical block before touching the file at all -- identical content returns `"already"` untouched; different content (stale path, old wording, a real pre-refresh block) returns `"block refreshed"`. Legacy `ASP:BEGIN`/`VACSKILL:BEGIN` stripping is unaffected and still works exactly as before -- only the case that was never actually "legacy" (a current SAIPEN block) stopped being needlessly destroyed. Verified empirically by running each script twice in a row: first run legitimately refreshed stale blocks (leftover from before this fix), second run reported `"already"` across every target with zero file writes -- true idempotency, not assumed.
- fix: mojibake in both scripts' own header comments (PowerShell double-encoding artifact, same corruption class as the v7.5.1 adapters bug) -- `sed`/`Edit` couldn't match the corrupted bytes for either file, so both were rewritten clean via full-file `Write` in plain ASCII, same fix strategy as v7.5.1. Full BOM/non-ASCII sweep on both confirmed clean.

## 7.5.1 -- 2026-07-20
- fix: all 9 `extensions/adapters/*.md` platform files (aider, claude, codex, deepseek, gemini, generic, openai, opencode, qwen) pointed at `saipen/PROTOCOL.md` -- a file that has never existed under that name since the vacskill->SAIPEN rename; the real file is `saipen/RFC.md`. Every one of these short pointer docs was sending a fresh agent on a platform-specific onboarding path straight into a dead link. Fixed across all 9.
- fix: `claude.md`, `codex.md`, `generic.md`, `opencode.md` also carried mojibake from an earlier PowerShell write (double-encoded arrow `->`, byte sequence unrenderable/corrupt in terminals) -- `sed` and even targeted `Edit` calls failed against the corrupted bytes (exact-string match failed at the byte level), so all four were rewritten clean via full-file replacement using plain ASCII (`->`, `--`) instead of Unicode arrows/em-dashes, permanently sidestepping the PowerShell encoding trap for these files. The other 5 adapters were re-verified byte-by-byte: their only non-ASCII bytes are correctly-encoded UTF-8 em-dashes (`E2 80 94`), not corruption -- left untouched. Full BOM sweep across all 9 files confirmed clean.

## 7.5.0 -- 2026-07-19
- feat (field audit, three live projects): checked how real agents actually use SAIPEN in practice (FastPrompter, Wintage, WildRiftAssistant) instead of only auditing the protocol in isolation. Found the LOG.md line format has zero real-world consensus -- three projects, three different formats, none matching STYLE.md's own example: FastPrompter uses `[E-001] DATE — LABEL:` (ID before date, no leading dash); Wintage uses phase names (`SCOUT:`/`BUILD:`) instead of a taxonomy; WildRiftAssistant has ZERO numeric Event IDs across all 85 LOG lines (uses `[HUNT]`/`[FIX]`/`[GOAL]` instead) and a literal `XX` placeholder for minutes in 57 separate entries. Root cause: the LOG line's structural skeleton lived only in STYLE.md (a voice/personality doc agents can reasonably deprioritize), not in RFC.md (always-loaded, strictly normative) -- and STYLE.md's own example didn't even include the `[E-###]` RFC already requires. RFC.md § 1.2 now states the exact skeleton (`- DATE [E-###] [parent: E-###] [T-###] TAXONOMY: text`) as MUST, with `RUN`/`DEC`/`H` as the closed, explicitly-named taxonomy (never declared as a closed set anywhere before this). STYLE.md's example fixed to match instead of contradict.
- fix: `phases/init.md` pointed at a `templates/` path that has never existed (the real path is `extensions/templates/`) and its own inline LOG example (`[E-001] DEC: Initialize SAIPEN`) violated the format it was teaching -- every fresh project's first log line was non-conformant by instruction. Also `extensions/templates/STATE.md` itself was missing `saipen_version`, `schema_version`, and `goal_mode` despite `init.md` listing them as MUST. All three reconciled; "or write manually" softened to a genuine fallback (degraded capability only), not an equally-valid default.
- Note: the three live projects' own existing `.saipen/LOG.md` history was NOT touched -- that's the user's active work under other agents' hands, not this repo's to rewrite. The fix is forward-looking: once each project's agent re-reads the refreshed protocol, new entries should conform.

## 7.4.6 -- 2026-07-19
- fix (the conformance suite was silently lying): explored `CONFORMANCE.md`, `extensions/`, and `tests/` for the first time this session and found `tests/validate.sh`/`validate.ps1` badly out of sync with the live protocol. (1) The `phase:` whitelist was missing `HUNT`, `ADD`, `CLEAN`, `TRANSLATE` entirely -- a validate run during any Maintenance phase would false-fail. (2) The LOG.md regex required `[E-###]` immediately after the dash with zero tolerance for the date prefix STYLE.md has mandated all along -- empirically, 0 of 34 correctly-dated lines in this repo's own `.saipen/LOG.md` matched it. (3) `validate.sh`'s check used `grep -q` (succeeds on ANY matching line) instead of verifying no line violates -- it was passing only because 124 leftover lines from an old un-dated import happened to satisfy the stale pattern, masking that literally none of today's real entries would. Fixed both scripts: phase whitelist completed, date prefix made optional-but-recognized, bash's any-match logic replaced with a real all-lines check (and its own `set -e` trap on a legitimately-empty `grep -v` result fixed along the way). Verified empirically -- both scripts now genuinely pass against this repo's real `.saipen/`, not by accident.
- fix: traced the false-pass to its root -- `phases/clean.md` never specified an exact LOG line format (same class of gap already fixed in `hunt.md`/`translate.md`), so a past agent invented a non-conformant `[E-CLEAN]` marker instead of a normal numbered Event ID. `clean.md` now specifies the exact format. The one historical `[E-CLEAN]` line was reformatted to a real `[E-115]` entry -- content and timestamp preserved, only the broken format corrected (not a content rewrite).
- fix: three `tests/scenarios/*/STATE.md` fixtures opened frontmatter with `--` instead of `---`. Harmless to the validators (they don't check delimiters) but objectively wrong YAML syntax; corrected for consistency.

## 7.4.5 -- 2026-07-19
- fix (the significant one): `phases/verify.md`'s cap said only "-> BLOCKED + facts" with no instruction to try other tickets first, and `phases/blocked.md` went straight to "ask the user, wait" with no check for remaining work -- combined with §2.4 treating any BLOCKED as a goal_mode-exit condition, one stuck ticket could halt an entire autonomous run even with five perfectly workable tickets still on the board. `verify.md` now marks only the stuck ticket blocked and moves to the next unblocked one; `blocked.md` (session-level, last resort) now re-checks the board before ever asking the user. `review.md`'s own "NO -- BLOCKER" cap was checked and is unaffected -- it already tickets the stubborn finding and continues, no fix needed there.
- fix: `phases/init.md` still wrote `asp_version: 7` into fresh `STATE.md` -- the one surviving leftover of the pre-rename protocol name, everywhere else (including this repo's own `.saipen/STATE.md`) uses `saipen_version`. Every newly bootstrapped project was getting an inconsistent schema from day one.
- fix: RFC.md §1.8's "strictly one by one" was ambiguous between BUILD scope (intended: don't mix tickets in one edit) and cadence (misreadable as: pause after each ticket) -- the latter reading directly contradicts `goal_mode`'s continuous-flow guarantee. Clarified explicitly.

## 7.4.4 -- 2026-07-19
- fix: Audited another agent's unreviewed commits to this repo (§1.8 Batch Input Parsing, Zero-Prompt Auto-Transition, TRANSLATE phase, ADD baseline constraints -- f709eed/57cb87f/a463be2, all confirmed sound). Found and fixed three real gaps in the new `phases/translate.md`: (1) "the kitchen" was ambiguous against §1.2's single `kitchen/` definition and contradicted the phase's own isolation rule -- `.saitranslate/kitchen/` is now explicit and cross-referenced from RFC.md §1.2; (2) "drawn flag icon" assumed image-generation tooling most text agents don't have -- Unicode flag emoji is now the stated universal baseline; (3) completion LOG line was free-text, tightened to the same exact-format convention as `hunt.md`. Also restructured `add.md`: Baseline Architectural Constraints (session persistence, no hardcoding) were nested inside the Industrial Completion Rule's bullet list despite being a distinct, always-applicable concern -- now its own numbered item.

## 7.4.3 -- 2026-07-19
- docs: README trimmed 79 -> 65 lines -- cut redundant/flavor prose (two intro paragraphs saying the same thing twice, decorative asides in the Evolution section), kept every fact intact (GOAL Mode safety valve, auto-push scope, VERIFY/REVIEW guarantee, install commands). Also fixed a stale version badge (was still showing v7.2.0).

## 7.4.2 -- 2026-07-19
- docs: Renamed "Optional acceleration" to "Optional Parallel Execution" in RFC.md §1.3 -- independence of the 6 HUNT categories is the trigger, speed is only the consequence. SPEC.md's Architecture section now states the verified layer independence explicitly: Core (correctness/continuation) works with zero Maintenance; Maintenance (unattended evolution) works identically with or without Goal Mode; Goal Mode and Subagents are both confirmed opt-in with no downstream dependency pointing back at them.

## 7.4.1 -- 2026-07-19
- fix: `phases/ship.md`'s terminal line ("After SHIP: STATE -> DONE") had zero mention of `goal_mode`, the same class of gap fixed in `done.md`/`review.md` a version ago -- a model landing here in one continuous turn could write `phase: DONE` without ever loading `done.md`'s goal_mode check in the same pass. Now checks explicitly. Full sweep of every other `DONE` transition in `phases/*.md` confirmed clean: `add.md`'s is the one legitimate exit condition (product mature) RFC §2.4 already defers to, and `clean.md` is purely human-triggered, already covered by `done.md`'s landing check.

## 7.4.0 -- 2026-07-19
- feat: `HUNT` fans its 6 independent signal categories out to parallel subagents when the platform supports spawning them (RFC.md §1.3, new optional `subagents` capability -- never required, never gates a phase). Subagents are read-only investigators; only the orchestrating agent writes BOARD/LOG, once, after merging results, avoiding write races by construction. No subagent support falls back silently to the existing sequential sweep -- identical cap, identical output, just slower.

## 7.3.3 -- 2026-07-19
- fix (root cause, found via a second WildRiftAssistant trace on the SAME bug after 7.3.2): `phases/done.md` item 3's HUNT-trigger condition was "the user simply typed `/saipen`" -- literally false when an agent arrives at DONE autonomously mid-`goal_mode` run, since the user typed nothing. A model reading `done.md` correctly would NOT transition to HUNT under that wording, no matter how clearly RFC.md §2.4 said to elsewhere. `done.md` now checks `goal_mode` FIRST, before any other branch, and forbids writing `next_action: wait for user command` while it's true.
- fix: `phases/review.md` had no "STATE -> DONE" branch at all, yet the observed trace jumped straight to DONE past the mandatory SHIP step. Added an explicit line: SHIP is mandatory before DONE, no exceptions, even under `goal_mode`.

## 7.3.2 -- 2026-07-19
- fix: Lowercased every command everywhere -- `saipen set`, `saipen goal`, `saipen init` (was inconsistently ALL-CAPS in RFC/README/guides/skill/injector). No functional change from casing.
- fix (real bug, found via a live WildRiftAssistant trace): Goal Mode's Exit clause let a momentarily empty `BOARD.md` count as "reached DONE," short-circuiting the mandatory HUNT->ADD Autonomous Transition (RFC.md §2.1) and stranding the agent at `next_action: wait for user command` instead of looping. RFC.md §2.4 now states explicitly: board-empty is a waypoint, not an exit; `goal_mode` persists through HUNT->ADD->HUNT->ADD until ADD itself gracefully concludes (product mature), BLOCKED, or the safety valve (3 waves/20 tickets) triggers. `phases/hunt.md` reinforced: the clean-hunt-to-ADD transition is unconditional and the LOG line format is exact, not free text.

## 7.3.1 -- 2026-07-18
- fix: Merged `saipen GOAL <text>` with the pre-existing (undocumented-in-RFC) "pivot" semantics already promised in the guides -- entering GOAL mode now demotes (never deletes) the current board and inserts the new objective's tickets on top, before running them to completion. Normalized casing to `saipen GOAL` everywhere (was inconsistently `goal` in RFC/phases/README, matching the pre-existing `saipen SET` convention). Updated README, GUIDE.md, GUIDE_EN.md, GUIDE_RU.md to describe the full merged behavior.

## 7.3.0 -- 2026-07-18
- feat: Introduced `saipen goal <text>` (RFC.md §2.4) -- an explicit, session-scoped autonomous mode that runs SCOUT->BUILD->VERIFY->REVIEW across successive tickets and waves without pausing to ask "shall I continue?". SHIP auto-pushes to an existing `origin` under `goal_mode`; first publish of a brand-new repository still requires explicit confirmation. VERIFY and REVIEW gates, and all existing caps (3 dead hypotheses / 2 fix cycles / 2 review passes), are never skipped. New safety valve: max 3 waves / 20 tickets per invocation before a mandatory checkpoint-and-report.

## 7.2.1 -- 2026-07-18
- docs: Refined the Industrial Completion Rule (`RFC.md` §2.3, `phases/add.md`). Replaced "functional cluster" with "user workflow" throughout for a clearer mental model. Added the "Complete before you extend" maxim: finish the requested workflow before proposing a different one, because agents should preserve user expectations before introducing new capabilities.

## 7.2.0 -- 2026-07-18
- feat: Introduced the `ADD` phase. The agent now acts as a product manager and lead engineer to systematically brainstorm and implement new features based on core UX rules (persistence, industry standards, maximum user control, safe step-by-step evolution).
- feat: Automated Continuous Evolution. When `BOARD.md` is empty, `/saipen` defaults to the `HUNT` phase to fix bugs. If `HUNT` finds a clean codebase, it automatically transitions to the `ADD` phase to safely evolve the software.
- doc: Added ELI5 "Grandpa Style" guides (`GUIDE_RU.md`, `GUIDE_EN.md`) and linked them with prominent shields.io badges in the `README.md`.
- fix: Replaced `inject.ps1` and `inject.sh` symlink (junction) creation with direct file copies to ensure maximum reliability across all agent platforms.
- fix: Restored Cyrillic UTF-8 encoding in `STYLE.md` to ensure correct persona injection for future agents.

## 7.1.2 -- 2026-07-17
- refactor: Renamed GitHub repository from `vacskill` to `saipen`. Updated all absolute URLs and git clone instructions.

## 7.1.1 -- 2026-07-17
- doc: Formally defined the boundary of SAIPEN regarding distributed consensus. SAIPEN explicitly states it is a local state protocol relying on atomic filesystem commits; true multi-machine network distribution requires an external "Coordinator" built on top of SAIPEN.

## 7.1.0 -- 2026-07-17
- refactor: Total Bootstrap Decoupling. Stripped all remaining platform-specific instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `VACSKILL:BEGIN`) from the `init.md` core phase. The core is now perfectly sterile and only initializes the `.saipen/` directory.
- chore: Replaced all legacy `VACSKILL:BEGIN` hooks with `SAIPEN:BEGIN` inside the bootstrap scripts.

## 7.0.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING / REWRITE: `PROTOCOL.md` has been brutally minimized (< 60 lines). 
- doc: Removed Abstract, Scope, Adapter Contract, and CLI commands from the core protocol machine document. These have been migrated to `SPEC.md` and `GUIDE.md` to prevent any context distraction.
- feat: `DONE` phase formally forbidden without successful `VERIFY` (or `MANUAL-VERIFY`), `needs` formalized as strict DAG, and `HUNT` signal dependency rigidly enforced.

## 6.3.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING / REWRITE: `PROTOCOL.md` has been brutally minimized (< 60 lines). 
- doc: Removed Abstract, Scope, Adapter Contract, and CLI commands from the core protocol machine document. These have been migrated to `SPEC.md` and `GUIDE.md` to prevent any context distraction.
- feat: `DONE` phase formally forbidden without successful `VERIFY` (or `MANUAL-VERIFY`), `needs` formalized as strict DAG, and `HUNT` signal dependency rigidly enforced.

## 6.2.0 -- 2026-07-17
- refactor: Ruthlessly purged all conversational/literary explanations from `PROTOCOL.md` to ensure the machine document remains absolutely cold and unambiguous.
- feat: Formalized Conformance into three strict vectors: Repo Validation, Session Validation, and Phase Contract Validation. `saipen validate` is now structurally mandated to enforce these vectors.

## 6.1.0 -- 2026-07-17
- doc: Reframed SAIPEN completely around the **"Continuation Test"**. Memory is a means to an end; instant action is the goal. Tagline changed to "One command. Zero amnesia."
- feat: Added `TEST-001: The Continuation Test` to the Conformance section as the gold standard for release validation.
- feat: `next_action` in `STATE.md` MUST now be an explicitly executable command (e.g. `pytest tests/`), not a vague intent, to ensure zero-context resumption.

## 6.0.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING / REBRAND: Renamed "Cross-Agent Project Memory Protocol" to **SAIPEN**.
- BREAKING: `LOG.md` events are no longer linear lists. They are now graph nodes identified by `[E-XXX]` and `[parent: E-XXX]`, enabling safe multi-agent branching and merges.
- feat: Implemented Two-Way Capability Negotiation. The protocol now dictates `requires:` in `STATE.md`, and the agent locks its `mode:` based on local capabilities.
- feat: Formalized Architecture Decision Records (ADR). Long-term truths live in `KNOWLEDGE/ADR-XXX.md` to prevent log bloat.
- feat: Expanded `extensions/` architecture with `security/` and `performance/` hook documentation.
- doc: Radically split documentation. `README.md` is now just a 5-minute pitch. `SPEC.md` is the human-readable RFC. `PROTOCOL.md` is strictly machine instructions. `GUIDE.md` is the human tutorial.

## 5.3.0 -- 2026-07-17
- feat: Added dedicated `validate` phase and `saipen validate` command.
- feat: Added `tests/validate.ps1` and `tests/validate.sh` conformance checker scripts.
- test: Added `tests/scenarios/` with 7 mock `.saipen` states for protocol compliance testing (crash-recovery, staleness, claim conflicts).
- struct: Explicitly separated Core (`saipen/`) from Adaptive Extensions (`extensions/` schemas, adapters, templates) to prevent protocol pollution.

## 5.2.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING / REWRITE: Converted the core `PROTOCOL.md` from a conversational guide into a strict, RFC-style normative specification.
- feat: Formalized the State Machine (`INIT РІвЂ вЂ™ PLAN РІвЂ вЂ™ SCOUT РІвЂ вЂ™ BUILD РІвЂ вЂ™ VERIFY РІвЂ вЂ™ REVIEW РІвЂ вЂ™ SHIP РІвЂ вЂ™ DONE | BLOCKED`).
- feat: Formalized Claim/Ownership logic (`owner` and `claim_time` added to `board.schema.json`) to prevent multi-agent race conditions.
- feat: Added Capability Negotiation handshake (agents MUST check capabilities like git/shell before engaging).
- feat: Added formal Recovery doctrine.
- doc: Stripped all "marketing copy" and persona out of `PROTOCOL.md` into non-normative abstracts, reinforcing that voice (`STYLE.md`) never overrides logic.

## 5.1.0 -- 2026-07-17
- feat: unified "Р Т‘Р ВµР Т‘ РЎРѓ РЎР‚Р В°Р в„–Р С•Р Р…Р В°" persona. Removed haiku requirement completely. The direct, witty, tough-love "grandpa" style is now the default for both chat responses and LOG entries (while maintaining strict caveman token compression and preserving facts verbatim).

## 5.0.1 -- 2026-07-17
- fix: extract missing `verify.md`, `review.md`, `done.md`, and `blocked.md` phases that were unintentionally merged or omitted in 5.0.0, which broke lazy loading when STATE entered these phases

## 5.0.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING: 2-tier protocol architecture. PROTOCOL.md is now a dense boot loader (~110 lines, ~1,200 tokens cold start). Phase-specific rules moved to lazy-loaded saipen/phases/ modules (init, plan, scout, build, ship, hunt). Agent loads only the phase it needs -- 60% fewer tokens per session vs monolithic v4. All rules preserved, zero lost. README rewritten for SAIPEN positioning
## 4.1.0 -- 2026-07-17
- Public launch edition: fix encoding corruption throughout (control chars -> clean ASCII, no BOM anywhere); README rewritten for public consumption with clean ASCII art; PROTOCOL.md audited and rebuilt clean

## 4.0.0 -- 2026-07-17
- BREAKING: skill -> protocol. saipen/PROTOCOL.md is the single vendor-neutral canon (240 lines, capability degradation table included); SKILL.md shrunk to a thin skill-reader adapter. New: adapters/ (9 platforms), templates/ (init boilerplate), style/ (opt-in voices), schemas/ frozen for a future orchestrator. Injectors point everything at PROTOCOL.md, upgrade stale 3.x blocks, and write UTF-8 without BOM. Positioning: vendor-neutral project execution protocol for LLM agents

## 3.1.2 -- 2026-07-16
- hotfix: ensure FreeBuff and Antigravity plugins receive copy, not junction, as their scanners ignore symlinks

## 3.1.1 -- 2026-07-15
- core reliability audit: HUNT skip was a phantom rule since 2.0.0 (no clean-line format, no anchor) -- now `hunt -> clean @<hash>` vs HEAD; legacy rename no longer assumes git; STYLE.md-missing fallback; REVIEW pass counter lives in LOG not memory; graph-mode claim race resolved by re-read; history prune made explicit. Net zero lines -- fixes paid for by compression

## 3.1.0a -- 2026-07-15
- drop _archive_versions/ -- identical twins of v1.2.2, already served by tags (`git show v1.2.2:VAC/SKILL.md`)

## 3.1.0 -- 2026-07-15
- anti-drift: STYLE.md Persistence section (voice holds every response, no revert after many turns) + protocol loads it upfront; git tags as release archive (all 17 past versions tagged retroactively); memory backup rule for non-git projects; self-imposed ~250-line cap -- SKILL.md compressed 281 -> 249 with zero rules lost

## 3.0.0 -- 2026-07-15
- BREAKING: renamed VAC -> saipen everywhere -- skill name, folder, memory dir (.vac/ -> .saipen/), pointer blocks (VACSKILL:BEGIN), repo (github.com/vacterro/saipen). Short alias `vac` still works for every command. Injector migrates pre-3.0 installs automatically; in projects run `git mv .vac .saipen`

## 2.1.0a -- 2026-07-15
- README rewritten for v2.x: angrier grandpa, phases/confidence/graph/KNOWLEDGE covered

## 2.1.0 -- 2026-07-15
- verify confidence (high/med/low) on DONE tickets; graph mode: parallel agents claim [P] tickets over needs: DAG; KNOWLEDGE index.md rule; vac status quick metrics

## 2.0.0 -- 2026-07-15
- protocol/personality split: SKILL.md cold protocol + new STYLE.md (voices); SCOUT and REVIEW promoted to phases (PLAN->SCOUT->BUILD->VERIFY->REVIEW->SHIP); KNOWLEDGE/ base (architecture/conventions/decisions/traps) -- LOG is journal only; BOARD needs: dependencies + no-free-will pick rule; minimal STATE

## 1.2.2 -- 2026-07-15
- injectors detect generic ~/.agents/skills (FreeBuff etc.); fixed broken-encoding stale copy there

## 1.2.1 -- 2026-07-15
- README rewritten: caveman English voice, ELI5 usage guide, half the size, twice the punch

## 1.2.0 -- 2026-07-15
- one-shot injectors inject.ps1 + inject.sh: auto-detect and wire all agentic systems (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity plugins, Aider), idempotent re-runs

## 1.1.5 -- 2026-07-15
- chat voice: compressed, direct, no filler; LOG persona unchanged

## 1.1.4a -- 2026-07-15
- voice boundaries hardened: LOG voice confined to .vac/ files only; chat strictly direct

## 1.1.4 -- 2026-07-15
- human dates DD.MM.YY HH:mm in LOG, wise-angry-grandpa commentary voice (facts stay exact), closing haiku on stop/ship; chat voice unchanged

## 1.1.3 -- 2026-07-15
- self-cleaning: scratch confined to .vac/tmp/ (deleted at stop/ship), orphan-file hunting with proven-unreferenced guard, no-litter iron rule

## 1.1.2 -- 2026-07-15
- publish target now user-agnostic: repo's own origin / logged-in gh account -- no hardcoded owner

## 1.1.1 -- 2026-07-15
- concurrent-agent takeover guard; new-machine bootstrap fallback in pointer block; .gitignore/.env guard before publish commits

## 1.1.0a -- 2026-07-15
- add "vac set" as official resume alias

## 1.1.0 -- 2026-07-15
- loop caps (3 hypotheses / 2 fix cycles -> BLOCKED, never spin); PUBLISH opt-in only (no auto-push of user projects); HUNT skips unchanged-clean repos; runtime token discipline section; unified checkpoint doctrine

## 1.0.1 -- 2026-07-15
- portable install: clone-anywhere paths, macOS/Linux symlinks; MIT LICENSE; SKILL.md init block uses <VAC_HOME> instead of hardcoded path

## 1.0.0 -- 2026-07-15
- first release: single VAC skill (PLAN/BUILD/CHECK/SHIP/HUNT loop), .vac/ cross-agent memory, ship-to-GitHub flow
