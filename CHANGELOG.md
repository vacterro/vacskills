# Changelog

## 3.1.2 — 2026-07-16
- hotfix: ensure FreeBuff and Antigravity plugins receive copy, not junction, as their scanners ignore symlinks

## 3.1.1 — 2026-07-15
- core reliability audit: HUNT skip was a phantom rule since 2.0.0 (no clean-line format, no anchor) — now `hunt -> clean @<hash>` vs HEAD; legacy rename no longer assumes git; STYLE.md-missing fallback; REVIEW pass counter lives in LOG not memory; graph-mode claim race resolved by re-read; history prune made explicit. Net zero lines — fixes paid for by compression

## 3.1.0a — 2026-07-15
- drop _archive_versions/ — identical twins of v1.2.2, already served by tags (`git show v1.2.2:VAC/SKILL.md`)

## 3.1.0 — 2026-07-15
- anti-drift: STYLE.md Persistence section (voice holds every response, no revert after many turns) + protocol loads it upfront; git tags as release archive (all 17 past versions tagged retroactively); memory backup rule for non-git projects; self-imposed ~250-line cap — SKILL.md compressed 281 → 249 with zero rules lost

## 3.0.0 — 2026-07-15
- BREAKING: renamed VAC → vacskill everywhere — skill name, folder, memory dir (.vac/ → .vacskill/), pointer blocks (VACSKILL:BEGIN), repo (github.com/vacterro/vacskill). Short alias `vac` still works for every command. Injector migrates pre-3.0 installs automatically; in projects run `git mv .vac .vacskill`

## 2.1.0a — 2026-07-15
- README rewritten for v2.x: angrier grandpa, phases/confidence/graph/KNOWLEDGE covered

## 2.1.0 — 2026-07-15
- verify confidence (high/med/low) on DONE tickets; graph mode: parallel agents claim [P] tickets over needs: DAG; KNOWLEDGE index.md rule; vac status quick metrics

## 2.0.0 — 2026-07-15
- protocol/personality split: SKILL.md cold protocol + new STYLE.md (voices); SCOUT and REVIEW promoted to phases (PLAN→SCOUT→BUILD→VERIFY→REVIEW→SHIP); KNOWLEDGE/ base (architecture/conventions/decisions/traps) — LOG is journal only; BOARD needs: dependencies + no-free-will pick rule; minimal STATE; FreeBuff fix: lowercase copy (readers skip junctions/uppercase)

## 1.2.2 — 2026-07-15
- injectors detect generic ~/.agents/skills (FreeBuff etc.); fixed broken-encoding stale copy there

## 1.2.1 — 2026-07-15
- README rewritten: ded-caveman English voice, ELI5 usage guide, half the size, twice the punch

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-15
- one-shot injectors inject.ps1 + inject.sh: auto-detect and wire all agentic systems (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity plugins, Aider), idempotent re-runs

## 1.1.5 — 2026-07-15
- chat voice = дед-caveman fusion: caveman compression + grandpa wit/мат/аналогии, clarity sacred; LOG persona unchanged

## 1.1.4a — 2026-07-15
- hard wall: дед voice + haiku confined to .vac/ files only; chat strictly caveman

## 1.1.4 — 2026-07-15
- дед-логгер: human dates DD.MM.YY HH:mm in LOG, wise-angry-grandpa commentary voice (facts stay exact), closing haiku on stop/ship; chat voice unchanged

## 1.1.3 — 2026-07-15
- self-cleaning: scratch confined to .vac/tmp/ (deleted at stop/ship), orphan-file hunting with proven-unreferenced guard, no-litter iron rule

## 1.1.2 — 2026-07-15
- publish target now user-agnostic: repo's own origin / logged-in gh account — no hardcoded owner

## 1.1.1 — 2026-07-15
- concurrent-agent takeover guard; new-machine bootstrap fallback in pointer block; .gitignore/.env guard before publish commits

## 1.1.0a — 2026-07-15
- add "vac set" as official resume alias

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-15
- loop caps (3 hypotheses / 2 fix cycles / 2 gate passes → BLOCKED, never spin); PUBLISH opt-in only (no auto-push of user projects); HUNT skips unchanged-clean repos; runtime token discipline section; unified checkpoint doctrine; 218→169 lines

## 1.0.1 — 2026-07-15
- portable install: clone-anywhere paths, macOS/Linux symlinks; MIT LICENSE; SKILL.md init block uses <VAC_HOME> instead of hardcoded path

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-15
- first release: single VAC skill (PLAN/BUILD/CHECK/SHIP/HUNT loop), .vac/ cross-agent memory, Win95 UI annex, caveman talk, ship-to-GitHub flow
