## 7.63.0 -- 2026-07-24 -- BUILD gained its own LOG instruction (misdiagnosed as "RUN is ambiguous", it wasn't)

A live FastPrompter session kept forgetting to LOG, got called out, and self-diagnosed: "RUN is semantically vague, I read it as 'whole session' not 'each discrete act,' AGENTS.md states the rule but has no enforcing mechanism" -- and proposed a new `DISCIPLINE.md` file to fix it.

Checked the live protocol before trusting that diagnosis. It was wrong: RFC § 1.5 already says plainly "MUST checkpoint after every ticket," not after every run or every edit -- there was no ambiguity to resolve. The real gap was mundane and much narrower: `build.md` (the phase where most edits actually happen) had zero instruction to LOG before transitioning to `VERIFY` -- every other phase doc ends with an explicit "LOG one Event Graph line, then transition" step; BUILD never did. And `BOOT.md` (the one file loaded on every cold start) never reinforced the per-ticket checkpoint cadence at all -- only RFC did, which is lazy-loaded "when a rule question comes up," so a session doing routine ticket work might never re-encounter it.

- `build.md` now closes with the same LOG-then-checkpoint pattern every other phase already has, explicit that it's one line per ticket, not one per edit.
- `BOOT.md` gained a short, generic reinforcement of the same per-ticket cadence, citing this exact incident so a future weak model recognizes the pattern instead of re-diagnosing it as a wording problem.

No new file, no second source of truth alongside RFC -- the fix closes the actual gap instead of adding competing machinery. `tools/validate.py` green.

## 7.62.0 -- 2026-07-24 -- `saipen sub sync` + mechanical extension discovery (T-170 b+c)

Two of T-170's three remaining verify items, closed with real mechanisms rather than left as open questions.

- **`saipen sub sync`** (PROTOCOL.md § 7): a project that spawned `extensions/subs/` before the SAIPEN home gained new shared vocabulary (the exact class of drift that broke bare-name recognition in a pre-v7.56.0 project) can now refresh just the shared reference files -- `PROTOCOL.md`/`README.md`/`crew.md`/`TEMPLATE/` -- from `saipen_home`, same freshness check `spawn` already does. It never touches a `<name>/` subSaipen's own `STATE.md`/`BOARD.md`/`LOG.md`/`kitchen/` -- by construction it never looks inside a `<name>/` folder at all, so live per-agent history stays exactly as protected as `spawn`'s own "refuse if already exists" rule already makes it.
- **`BOOT.md`** -- loaded on every cold start, Core-only, zero crew-coupling -- now tells an agent facing an unrecognized single word (not a known § 1.10 command) to check `.saipen/extensions/*/PROTOCOL.md`/`README.md` for an RFC § 1.9 extension defining it, *before* guessing (FreeBuff's earlier "saipen"+"python" portmanteau) or declining outright (OpenCode's earlier flat refusal). This is the cheapest point in the whole read order to close that inferential gap -- the file every session reads first, generic enough to name §1.9's mechanism without naming crew specifically.

Both re-deployed live via a second authorized injector run and verified by diff against the actual installed `~/.config/opencode/skills/saipen/` and `~/.agents/skills/saipen/` (FreeBuff's own read path) folders -- not just source-committed.

T-170's third item (test against weak/free-tier models specifically) still needs an actual live re-test once FreeBuff's own uptime allows -- the user's closure bar (this agent personally verifies end-to-end before "in development" language changes) still governs. `tools/validate.py` green.

## 7.61.0 -- 2026-07-24 -- worktree-aware `.saipen/` resolution + injector fix deployed live (T-170)

A fresh OpenCode session reported "No `.saipen/` at project root, not initialized here" for a FastPrompter checkout that plainly has one. Root cause traced live, not guessed: `.saipen/` is gitignored by design (RFC's own local-only working-memory rule), and the platform (confirmed via `git worktree list`: FreeBuff creates `.freebuff/worktrees/<id>/` per thread) spawns each session into a **linked git worktree** -- which only receives tracked content, so `.saipen/` never arrives even though the main worktree has one. Verified directly: `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` from inside the linked worktree resolves to the main repo's real `.git`, and `.saipen/` is confirmed absent there, present at the real root. This is likely the actual explanation behind an earlier FreeBuff "No read access" report too, reframed -- not a permission block, a genuinely absent path.

- **`RFC.md` § 1.1 and `BOOT.md`** now instruct checking `--git-common-dir` for a linked-worktree signal (a path ending `/.git`, not a bare `.git`) before concluding "not initialized" -- resolve the main worktree's root and look there instead of defaulting to `saipen set`, which would have silently created a second, disconnected `.saipen/` and orphaned the real continuation memory.
- **Injector re-run, authorized and executed.** `bootstrap/inject.ps1` run against this machine and verified by diff (not trust): `extensions/subs/PROTOCOL.md` § 7 + `crew.md` are now byte-identical between source and the live `~/.claude/skills/saipen/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/saipen/`, `~/.agents/skills/saipen/` folders; the new worktree-resolution text confirmed present in all three. The "global skill never carried extensions/subs/" failure from v7.58.0 is now actually closed on this machine, not just source-fixed.

T-170 stays open -- live crew re-verification is still paused pending FreeBuff's own uptime, and the user's explicit closure bar (this agent must personally run and verify the full 3-role mechanism end-to-end) still governs when "in development" framing in the docs may change. `tools/validate.py` green.

## 7.60.0 -- 2026-07-24 -- README/GUIDE freshness pass: platform list + honest saicrew mention

User asked "is README current?" -- checked every claim against live RFC (core loop, HUNT/ADD, 3-wave/20-ticket cap, `sk-***` redaction) and all came back accurate. The gaps were in what's missing, not what's wrong:

- **Platform list undercounted.** README and GUIDE.md both said the injector "teaches Claude Code, Gemini, OpenCode, Aider, Antigravity" -- five. `bootstrap/inject.ps1`/`.sh` actually cover seven: missing **Codex CLI** and the generic `~/.agents/skills` reader (**FreeBuff**, etc.). Both docs corrected.
- **saicrew was invisible.** A fully-shipped feature set (v7.52.0-7.58.0: saipython, the crew bonus layer, BOOT.md) had zero mention anywhere in README or the GUIDE.md hub. Added one honest line to each, framed as **in development / under active live testing, not yet verified end-to-end** -- not oversold as finished. The four guides that already described the spawn mechanism in detail (DED/EE/EN/RU) were checked and already carried the right cautious tone ("brand new, zero battle scars yet") -- left untouched.
- **Closure bar recorded on T-170**: the user set it explicitly -- this agent must personally run and verify the full 3-role mechanism end-to-end before the "in development" framing (in docs or on the board) upgrades to anything stronger. Recorded verbatim on the ticket so it survives any future checkpoint.

`tools/validate.py` green.

## 7.59.0 -- 2026-07-24 -- no default haiku (again -- it snuck back in)

Turns out this protocol killed a closing-haiku requirement once before (pre-v7: "Removed haiku requirement completely... Haiku deleted", CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md). It quietly came back anyway -- not as a rule, just as an unrecorded habit -- and ended up baked into a real shipped file: `extensions/subs/crew.md`'s closing verse, paid for on every load.

- Removed the verse from `crew.md`.
- Added an explicit `STYLE.md` line (next to the existing no-multi-language-garnish rule, same reasoning) so it doesn't quietly grow back a third time: no default closing haiku/verse in chat or in any shipped file, opt-in only when the user asks for one in the moment.

`tools/validate.py` green (no structural surface touched).

## 7.58.0 -- 2026-07-24 -- crew dogfooding: three real spec gaps found and fixed live (T-170)

Running an actual 3-agent crew test on FastPrompter (two free-tier weak models: FreeBuff/OpenCode Zen both on DeepSeek V4 Flash) surfaced real gaps no amount of internal review had caught. Each is fixed at the source, not patched around.

- **Global skill never carried `extensions/subs/` at all.** Confirmed by directly querying FreeBuff's own local `.freebuff/desktop.db` (a real, readable SQLite store -- threads/messages/parts_json) mid-session: the agent loaded the "saipen" skill, read the globally-injected RFC/STYLE/UI, found zero mention of subSaipen roles anywhere, and reasoned `saipython` was a "saipen"+"python" portmanteau -- a plausible wrong guess, not a failed lookup. `bootstrap/inject.sh`/`inject.ps1`'s `copy_skill()` never included `extensions/subs/` in the distributed bundle. Both scripts now copy it; `tools/validate.py`'s `dist_tokens` check extended to catch a regression here. (Re-running the injector against this machine's actual installed skill folders is a separate, larger action -- not done automatically, needs the operator's own go-ahead.)
- **`TEMPLATE/BOARD.md` shipped empty, no example.** A live saihunt run (once it did understand its role) invented its own board shape by copying `OUTBOX.md`'s bold-field markdown instead of RFC §1.2's checkbox ticket line -- nothing in `PROTOCOL.md` or the template contradicted that guess. Fixed: an explicit example in both `TEMPLATE/BOARD.md` and `PROTOCOL.md` §1, spelling out that the board uses Core's checkbox shape, never the OUTBOX shape.
- **Spawn instructions never told an agent to set a real `updated:` timestamp.** `PROTOCOL.md` §7 explicitly listed `agent:` and `saipen_home:` as fields to replace at spawn, but not `updated:` -- observed directly: FastPrompter's spawned saihunt bumped only the *date* half of `TEMPLATE/STATE.md`'s placeholder and left the time at `00:00:00` (a partial-placeholder edit, not a real checkpoint). §7 now lists `updated:` explicitly too.

Also fixed (from the same live session, before the above): a project that spawned `subs/` before v7.56.0 has a frozen `PROTOCOL.md` snapshot missing the crew's bare-name command table -- ad-hoc synced in FastPrompter directly; a durable `saipen sub sync`-style refresh path is still open (T-170 remains on the board, live crew re-verification paused by the user pending FreeBuff's own uptime -- unrelated to any of the above).

`tools/validate.py` green throughout.

## 7.57.0 -- 2026-07-24 -- T-136 closed: MARKHUNT gets a manifest-driven closure self-test

The last open Core ticket -- deferred as design-debt for eight versions because it needed real design, not a rush. MARKHUNT could sweep the surface and declare itself done on pure self-report; HUNT has an exact hash-match skip as a hard closure check, MARKHUNT had nothing analogous. Now it does.

- `.saipen/kitchen/markhunt_progress.md` is now a **manifest**, not a vague note: `vectors:` (which of the 5 scope categories are done), `surface:` (dirs/globs swept), `findings:` (count), `cursor:`, and `head_start:`/`head_end:` (short HEAD hashes).
- **Closure self-test** before `DONE`: `cursor: done`, all 5 vectors present, `head_end` == current HEAD (HEAD moved mid-pass = stale coverage, re-run the moved part), and `findings:` == the `[MARKHUNT]` tickets actually written. Any mismatch = not done, resolve it, never round up.
- The completion line is enriched -- `markhunt -> N findings, V/5 vectors, @head` -- so coverage stays auditable from permanent `LOG.md` after `kitchen/` is swept; a human or VALIDATE cross-checks `N` against the board's `[MARKHUNT]` tickets and that `V` is 5. No `validate.py` change -- the closure is self-enforced and LOG-recorded, no busywork ceremony (exactly what the ticket cautioned against).

CONFORMANCE row 37 + scenario stub. The board now holds only the two saitranslate tickets (T-168/T-169), both correctly deferred to a dedicated/parallel TRANSLATE run rather than fabricated under limits. `tools/validate.py` green.

## 7.56.0 -- 2026-07-24 -- saicrew: run a 3-agent crew with one command each (bonus, zero Core change)

Read the operator's `thoughts/` on running subSaipens as real-time workers and built exactly that -- as a pure bonus layer. Not one RFC rule, phase doc, `validate.py` field, or schema was touched: the crew is assembled entirely from mechanisms Core already ships (subSaipens, OUTBOX, claim locks, the safety valve, `saipen sub` commands).

The picture: you dig the tunnel (the Core agent, `mode: full`, the only writer of real code), and two workers set the beams behind you -- **saihunt** (the sensor, finds bugs) and **saipython** (the fixer, clears the tail from its `pen/`). Both read-only toward the project; their only door out is the OUTBOX; Core pulls through `saipen sub collect`.

- **`extensions/subs/crew.md`** -- the squad contract: three roles + zones, the one-command-per-window flow, the auto-collect gate, graceful degradation, and a pitfall->mechanism table mapping every classic multi-agent failure (amnesia, two agents on one ticket, zombie tickets, fake green, runaway autonomy, dirty-tree panic, stale patches, valve pile-up) to the Core mechanism that already kills it. Zone/done_by/delegation ride as **description tags** (`[zone: src/auth/**]`), never new `|` pipe-fields -- keeping `validate.py`'s `KNOWN_FIELDS` and Core untouched.
- **One-command role adoption** (`extensions/subs/PROTOCOL.md` § 7) -- a bare subSaipen name (`saihunt`, `saipython`, `saiwiki`) spawns-if-needed, *becomes* that sub (reads its own STATE/BOARD, never the main project's), and starts its loop. Type one word -> the agent is that worker and working. `saipen crew` prints the layout.
- **`bootstrap/saipen_crew.bat` / `saipen_crew.sh`** -- one click opens three terminals, each with its command pre-typed.
- The three example subs' `STATE.md` `next_action` now auto-start their own cycle on adoption; crew registered in MANIFEST, subs README, and the injector's global block.

Possible without touching Core because the subSaipen extension (§ 1.9) was built for exactly this -- it layers on top, it never relaxes what Core requires. `tools/validate.py` green (16 phases, 13 manifest files, 3 subs -- all unchanged).

## 7.55.0 -- 2026-07-23 -- ergonomics batch: BOOT kernel, human-digest, human_note, guide pointers

The "10 seconds per session" pass -- everything here cuts what a human or a cold agent has to read.

- **`saipen/BOOT.md`** (T-158) -- a ~30-line cold-start kernel. A bare `saipen continue` reads BOOT -> STATE -> BOARD -> active LOG tail -> executes `next_action`, loading the full RFC only when a rule question actually comes up. A third tier under the 2-tier loader; wired into `SKILL.md`, both injectors, and the `validate.py` manifest. TEST-001 passes off BOOT + STATE + BOARD + tail alone.
- **Human digest** (T-159) -- `saipen ship` and `saipen stop` now (over)write `.saipen/kitchen/digest.md`: three lines (done / remaining / awaiting) so the human opens one snapshot instead of scrolling `LOG.md`.
- **`human_note:`** (T-162) -- optional STATE field, a one-line human->agent nudge read on continue (BOOT step 4) and cleared once applied. Not a ticket, not a goal; one that implies work becomes a real `TODO`. Added to `state.schema.json` as an optional field.
- **BLOCKED-triage nudge** (T-160) -- CLEAN now escalates a ticket that's neither resolvable nor prunable but has rotted across passes into a concrete, two-word-answerable `WAIT:`, instead of letting it sit in the morgue.
- **Guide command drift** (T-153) -- every guide (`GUIDE.md` + 33 `guides/GUIDE_*.md`) now carries an explicit pointer to RFC §1.10 as the authoritative command list, closing the onboarding gap audit5 #13 flagged.
- **Command-surface compression** (T-161) -- reviewed and **rejected**, recorded in `KNOWLEDGE/decisions.md`: the surface is already tiered (three common commands + a rare tail by design), and `saipen x <cmd>`/flags would be churn that collides with the subs `saipen sub` vocabulary for no real gain.

CONFORMANCE rows 34-36 + scenario stubs. `T-136` (MARKHUNT completeness self-test) stays the one open item -- P3 design-debt, deferred on purpose. `tools/validate.py` green.

## 7.54.0 -- 2026-07-23 -- phase-collapse audits reviewed and rejected (recorded, made findable)

Three phase-audits (`tofix/saipen_phaseAudit1/2/3`) all argued the same thing -- 16 phases is too many, collapse them (to 5, 8, and 4 respectively; they didn't even agree with each other). Reviewed and rejected, and the rejection is now recorded where it will actually stop the next identical audit instead of costing a fresh analysis each time.

- The token premise is already solved by the 2-tier lazy-load (v5.0.0): a phase doc costs nothing until its phase is active, so 16 small focused docs beat 8 fat merged ones -- phaseAudit2 admits merging makes every `hunt` call also load `add`+`markhunt`. Collapsing *raises* per-call tokens.
- The specific merges (scout+build, verify+review) undo deliberate v2.0.0 splits already recorded in `KNOWLEDGE/decisions.md` with reasons (scout separate so agents read before coding; VERIFY "works?" separate from REVIEW "well made?").
- The rewrite surface (RFC §1.6, CONFORMANCE enum + 33 scenarios, `validate.py`, `state.schema.json`, the subs PROTOCOL's enum reuse, 33 guides) re-opens 100+ versions of phase-specific hardening (VERIFY hysteresis, the ADD->HUNT / DONE->ADD phantom removals) for an illusory-to-negative gain.

Recorded the full rejection in `KNOWLEDGE/decisions.md` (same treatment `goal_exit` got), added a findable pointer at RFC §1.6's phase enum, and deleted the three consumed audits. Do not re-propose without a real trace showing the phase count actually costs tokens or causes a stall.

## 7.53.0 -- 2026-07-23 -- anti-bloat + cold-start: log segmentation, changelog archival, MARKHUNT triage, audit7 polish

Consolidation pass aimed at one thing: keep the files a cold agent actually reads small, so continuation stays cheap on weak hardware and never overflows a context window.

**LOG segmentation (RFC § 1.2).** `LOG.md` was append-only *and* unbounded -- 695 lines here, big enough to get truncated when loaded into context (which is how an earlier reviewer "lost" 75% of the history). Now segmented: sealed older entries live in `.saipen/logs/LOG-<NNN>.md`, the active tail in `.saipen/LOG.md`. Sealing moves whole lines verbatim (append-only holds across the boundary); `E-###` stays globally monotonic and `[parent: E-###]` resolves across segments. Only the small active tail is read for normal operation (§ 1.1 tail read, § 1.5 Recovery); `tools/validate.py` reads sealed + active as one sequence. This repo's own LOG was rotated: 679 entries sealed to `LOG-001.md`, active `LOG.md` down to 15. Sealing is a natural `CLEAN` step.

**CHANGELOG archival.** Same disease, same cure: the newest ~10 entries stay here, the rest move to `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`. The head is what anyone reads; the tail is cold history.

**MARKHUNT triage (T-149..T-152) cleared from `## BLOCKED`.** The four unvetted audit findings recorded earlier were triaged and resolved: goal_tickets counting semantics documented (RFC § 2.4 -- it counts VERIFY-passes, deliberate and fails safe); parallel TRANSLATE now deletes its own transient `saitranslate/STATE.md` (translate.md); kitchen crash-integrity spelled out (a file truncated mid-write is debris, restart clean, RFC § 1.2); a doc-explicitness cluster where the no-git HUNT-skip and the ticket `verify:` field got explicit wording, the rest marked WONTFIX-by-design.

**audit7 polish.** `add.md` pseudocode gained the missing `CLAIM(ticket)` (was out of sync with RFC § 2.2); the phantom `ADD -> HUNT` transition was removed from the § 1.6 table (add.md calls it illegal -- same phantom class as the already-removed `DONE -> ADD`); the ADD Act-section now points at the two implementation paths instead of reading as "everything goes to PLAN/SCOUT".

**saipython.** The fixer charter gained a hard CPU/RAM/disk-friendly rule -- every patch must be at least as light as what it replaces (stream don't slurp, no accidental O(n^2), nothing grows unbounded), assume the code runs on a potato.

**Smaller:** `next_action` MAY now carry a compact progress tag (`[3/7 done, 1 blocked]`) so the human reads progress without `saipen status` (RFC § 1.2); `T-136` reclassified from a mislabeled P0 to P3 design-debt (a missing self-test, not a bleeding bug); the last consumed `tofix/` audit deleted (the repo carries exactly one canonical copy of every file -- verified, no duplicates). A batch of ergonomics ideas (BOOT.md fast-loader, auto human-digest, BLOCKED-triage nudge, human_note feedback field, command-surface review) is ticketed T-158..T-162 for a focused later pass, deliberately NOT crammed in here.

`tools/validate.py` green (2 log segments, 3 subSaipens).

## 7.52.0 -- 2026-07-23 -- saipython: the first fixer-type subSaipen (reverse-end Python fixer)

Added a new class of subSaipen and the first instance of it. saiwiki and saihunt *report* -- a finding, a draft, a proposal. A **fixer** goes one step further: its OUTBOX deliverable is a ready, already-tested patch. saipython is that fixer, Python-specialized, aimed at the *tail* of a project -- the low-severity bugs (lint/type nits, small correctness fixes, missing error paths, dead code) the main agent keeps deprioritizing. Main works the trunk; saipython clears the tail; the whole thing ships faster.

The reconciliation with the subSaipen prime rule (never write the main project) is the same one parallel TRANSLATE already uses: write freely, but only inside your own sandbox. saipython clones target files into its own `kitchen/pen/`, fixes and tests the *copy* there, and hands back a unified diff via OUTBOX. It never writes the main tree, and its `STATE.phase` never becomes `BUILD`/`SHIP` (unreachable under `mode: read-only`, enforced by `tools/validate.py`) -- it drafts in the pen (a `SCOUT` kitchen activity, exactly like saiwiki drafting a page) and proves the fix in phase `VERIFY`, which IS reachable for a sub. The main agent applies the patch through Core `VERIFY -> REVIEW -> SHIP`; the sub's green run is evidence that saves time, never a substitute for Core's gates.

- **`extensions/subs/PROTOCOL.md` § 9** -- new "Fixer-type subSaipen" section: the pen sandbox, verify-in-sandbox, capability gate (missing toolchain -> degrade to an `unverified` finding, never fake green), patch-shaped OUTBOX (`base_head` + quoted test result + unified diff), freshness on the way out and in, and the reverse-end scope discipline (one minimal fix per patch, tail only, never a refactor epic). `PY-` added to the ticket namespace (§ 3).
- **`extensions/subs/saipython/`** -- STATE (`mode: read-only`), BOARD (PY-001..005 fix categories), LOG, `kitchen/OUTBOX.md`, `kitchen/pen/`, and a full mentor charter `README.md`: real Python-pro craft (correctness before cleverness, minimal surgical diffs, root cause not symptom, stdlib before deps, honest error handling, security even on small fixes) plus the teacher's charge -- do the ticket exactly and verified, then exceed with discipline (prove the sibling bug others walked past as a *separate* finding, polish only inside the diff you already need), and grow (log durable lessons for the next run). Hard walls: never touch the main tree, never a feature/refactor epic, never fake green, one fix per patch.
- **MANIFEST.md / subs README** -- saipython registered as the third bundled example (the fixer).
- **CONFORMANCE row 33** + `tests/scenarios/fixer-subsaipen-patch-outbox/` -- the fixer stays read-only toward the project and reaches it only as a main-applied, gate-checked patch.

`tools/validate.py` green (3 active subSaipens). No change to `validate.py` was needed -- the fixer fits the existing read-only policy by construction.

## 7.51.0 -- 2026-07-23 -- audit5: four real RFC/phase-doc fixes, eight ghost findings verified already-closed

Processed a fresh external audit (`tofix/saipen_audit5.md`, 13 findings). Most were written against an older snapshot -- eight were verified already-closed against the live files (grep, not memory): MARKHUNT's `## BLOCKED` (not TODO) recording, done.md's TODO-before-goal-HUNT ordering, the `saipen SYMPTOM` phantom command, VERIFY hysteresis, HUNT's `## BLOCKED` dedupe, translate.md's 32-language count, plan.md's size-gate "no correctness gate skipped" wording, and blocked.md's `-> DONE` path. Five were real; four fixed here, one ticketed.

- **#6 stop vs bare `saipen goal` counter contradiction (RFC §1.10)** -- the real bug. §1.10 said any resume after `stop` continues "precisely as if the stop had never happened," lumping all three resume commands together, but §2.4 Entry has bare `saipen goal` reset `goal_waves`/`goal_tickets` to 0. Split explicitly: `saipen continue`/bare `saipen` preserve the counters; bare `saipen goal` deliberately resets them for a fresh safety-valve budget (that reset is the whole point of re-invoking it past a tripped valve). "As if the stop never happened" now scopes to the continue paths only.
- **#5 read-only coverage of audit/validate phases (RFC §1.3)** -- MARKHUNT/PREPARE/VALIDATE quietly write (BOARD tickets, kitchen/handoff, structural repair). read-only now reaches them only in report-only form: run and report in chat, write nothing.
- **#7 goal_waves double-count via ADD -> PLAN (RFC §2.4, plan.md, add.md)** -- ADD increments `goal_waves` at its RETURN; when that RETURN was `PLAN`, the following PLAN run incremented again for the same HUNT->ADD cycle. plan.md now skips its increment when entered directly from ADD's RETURN; add.md and §2.4 carry the matching note. Failed safe (over-counted, tripped early) but real.
- **#8 version guard with no VERSION file (RFC §1.2)** -- previously undefined. Missing/unreadable/unparseable `VERSION` now degrades to `mode: read-only`, same as the stale-RFC end of the guard, instead of writing a guessed `saipen_version`.

CONFORMANCE rows 30-32 added with matching `tests/scenarios/` READMEs. #13 (guide command-drift -- validate/plan/status/goal/stop/ship missing across the 33 guide files) is real onboarding debt but a 33-file chore -- ticketed T-153, not bundled here. `tools/validate.py` green.

## 7.50.0 -- 2026-07-23 -- T-148: markhunt/prepare synced across all 33 guide translations
Closed out the two tickets this session opened on itself (T-147 shipped as part of v7.49.0's own batch is separate; this is T-148, the concrete follow-through T-124 pointed at).

Checked all 33 `guides/GUIDE_XX.md` files individually rather than assuming uniformity -- turned out to matter: 29 had a plain 8-row table (set/continue/stop/status/goal/clean/translate/ship) with neither `saipen markhunt` nor `saipen prepare`; 4 (EN, RU, EE, DED -- the bonus "Дед" voice) already carried `markhunt` from an earlier manual pass but still lacked `prepare`. Added whichever was missing to each file:

- The 29 plain files each gained both rows, inserted between `translate` and `ship`, in a short phrase matching that file's existing terseness.
- EN/RU (rich 3-column persona-named tables) and EE/DED (simpler description-only) each gained a `prepare` row matching their own established style and row order -- RU's own markhunt-before-translate ordering was kept as-is rather than forced into GUIDE.md's canonical order.

Deliberately did not backfill `validate`/`plan`/`status`/`goal` gaps noticed in several files along the way -- those predate this session's own markhunt/prepare additions to GUIDE.md and are a separate, pre-existing scope, not what T-124/T-148 were tracking.

Both validators green.

## 7.49.0 -- 2026-07-23 -- last 11 MARKHUNT tickets closed + a fresh 26-finding subSaipen audit distilled
Drove the MARKHUNT backlog to zero and processed a brand-new external audit (`tofix/SAIPEN_SUBSAIPEN_AUDIT.md`, 26 findings against `extensions/subs/PROTOCOL.md`) in the same pass. Both tofix/ audit files deleted once fully extracted, per standing permission.

**RFC-level tickets (T-124..T-140), each verified against live files first:**
- **Real, fixed**: LOG skeleton missing `[agent:]`/`T-none` (T-126); transition table's `DONE -> ADD` was never actually implemented by any phase doc -- `done.md` itself says ADD is only ever reached via a clean HUNT, so the table entry was removed, not implemented (T-127); `saipen stop`'s interaction with `goal_mode` was never stated directly -- now explicit: stop pauses, never clears it (T-129); the unknown-command rule didn't check active extensions' own commands first, contradicting § 1.9's own carve-out for e.g. `saipen sub spawn` (T-130); `goal_waves`' HUNT->ADD increment timing clarified (fires at ADD's own `RETURN`, not the resulting ticket's eventual completion) + README's command list expanded from 4 to 10 (T-131); HUNT now checks `## BLOCKED` (not just TODO/DOING) before ticketing a finding, so a known-but-blocked issue can't fork into two tickets (T-133, one of four sub-parts); VERIFY gained hysteresis -- a ticket blocked a second time escalates to session-level `BLOCKED` instead of a fresh retry budget (T-138, CONFORMANCE row 28 added).
- **Real but the fix was ownership, not mechanism**: GUIDE.md's markhunt/prepare rows never reached the 32 hand-maintained `guides/GUIDE_XX.md` siblings -- `translate.md` now states plainly that its own drift-rescan permanently excludes hand-maintained siblings, so nothing was silently assuming auto-sync; the actual 32-file content fix is now its own ticket, T-148 (T-124).
- **False alarms, closed with reasoning**: `blocker: none` vs empty, checkpoint ordering, and "phase history not tracked" (already an accepted, documented gap, CONFORMANCE row 14 -- whose stale "fourteen"-phase count got bumped to sixteen while re-checking it) (T-133, remaining sub-parts); bare-goal/init-WAIT/plan-size-gate all already consistent, likely fixed by an earlier fix this session (T-132); `BLOCKED -> DONE` already documented in `blocked.md` step 5 (T-127, one sub-part); `next_action`'s single-field design already unifies its "audiences" via the existing "`WAIT:` counts as executable" framing -- splitting it would add sync surface to solve a solved problem (T-137); the `goal_waves`/`goal_tickets` dual cap's orthogonality is the safety valve working as designed, not a flaw -- a runaway on either axis still stops and reports (T-140).

**SubSaipen audit (26 findings, grouped T-144/145/146):** 18 real+fixed in `extensions/subs/PROTOCOL.md` (OUTBOX `reviewed` status + backpressure cap + collect-time freshness check + severity field + partial-collect + `_shared/inbox.md` given real shape/ownership/prune rule; T-### translation rule for folded findings + cross-file traceability via the RUN: line text, no RFC change needed; TEMPLATE/STATE.md gained `saipen_home` + a real placeholder; collect's write order now matches RFC § 1.5's crash-safety asymmetry; `saipen sub status`/`pause`/`resume` added; MANIFEST timestamps; BLOCKED subSaipens now surface in `sub list` and get reviewed on the HUNT cadence; spawn validates `saipen_home` first and refuses on an existing `<name>`; clean actively checks+refuses instead of just stating its precondition; HUNT's kitchen sweep now explicitly covers subSaipen kitchens too). 5 dismissed as false alarms (subSaipen tickets already reach DONE at prepare-time regardless of collect, independent of any feedback loop; RFC § 1.2 already fully specifies ticket shape; the TEMPLATE OUTBOX.md file the audit said was missing already exists; the spawn race already lives inside RFC § 1.4's accepted concurrency boundary; restricting the phase enum would contradict § 1's own explicit "procedural, not technical" design). 1 deferred to its own properly-scoped ticket, T-147 (`validate.py` subSaipen coverage is real code work, not a doc-sync pass).

Both validators green.

## 7.48.0 -- 2026-07-23 -- prepare.md and build.md were missing standard phase-doc scaffolding
A fourth external audit (`tofix/saipen_audit3_aboutPhases.md`, cleaner and better-organized than the first three, 32 grouped findings across all 15 phase docs). ~80% overlapped what was already closed or already tracked in `BOARD.md`. Checked the four genuinely new claims directly:

- Two false alarms: an "enum prose says 14-value but lists 15" off-by-one -- no such string exists anywhere in the live file; and a claim that duplicate `hunt(1).md`/`scout(1).md` files exist on disk -- they don't.
- Two real, both simple missing scaffolding every *other* phase doc already has: `prepare.md` never required a completion `LOG` line (every other terminal phase -- `hunt.md`, `clean.md`, `translate.md`, `markhunt.md`, `ship.md` -- does); added, plus an explicit `BLOCKED` path for a failed preparation. `build.md` never mentioned `BLOCKED` at all despite RFC's own transition table listing `BUILD -> VERIFY | BLOCKED` -- added a one-line branch for an unrecoverable build error.

Both validators green.
