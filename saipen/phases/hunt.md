# Phase: HUNT (no TODO tickets remaining)

Clean sweep. Skip ONLY if `.saipen/LOG.md`'s tail literally contains
`hunt -> clean @<HASH>` where `<HASH>` is the exact output of
`git rev-parse --short HEAD` run right now -- compute the hash first,
then grep for that exact string. Anything else -- no match, an older
hash, no `hunt -> clean` line at all -- run the full sweep below. No
exceptions, no substitute heuristic.

**A real incident**: a weaker model, finding the prior hunt line stale,
independently invented its own skip condition -- "no source files
changed since the last hunt's timestamp, call it clean" -- instead of
the hash-match rule above. Told to re-read this doc, it caught the hash
mismatch correctly, then made the SAME substitution a second time anyway:
it diffed file mtimes again and declared "0 changes, all 6 categories
the same, HUNT clean" -- without actually re-running a single one of
the six checks below. Both moves are illegal, and the second is worse
for being dressed up as compliance. "Nothing on disk changed recently"
is not evidence of "nothing is wrong" -- a silent `except: pass`, a
stale TODO, or dead code don't announce themselves via mtime, and the
prior hunt in that incident had found 2 open tickets; if those are
still unticketed, a fresh hunt cannot honestly call itself clean no
matter how quiet the filesystem has been. There is no shortcut around
actually performing the six checks below, every time this phase runs
for real.

**Subagents available (RFC § 1.3)?** Dispatch the 6 signal categories below
as one batch of parallel subagent tasks instead of scanning them in turn.
Each subagent is read-only: it investigates and returns findings, it MUST
NOT touch `.saipen/` itself -- only the orchestrating agent writes BOARD/LOG,
once, after merging every subagent's results. This avoids write races by
construction. No subagent support -> run the same 6 categories sequentially,
exactly as below. Either path, the cap and output are identical.

Signal order, cap 5 tickets:
1. Failing tests
2. Commits unverified in LOG
3. Stale TODO/FIXME/HACK
4. Silent failures (empty catch, ignored returns, missing IO error paths)
5. Symmetry gaps (save/load, undo/redo, import/export, start/stop)
6. Dead code, orphan files (zero grep refs, not entry/doc/config)

Obvious junk -> delete free, capped at 5 files per sweep (same cap as the
ambiguous tickets above), and never user data (anything a user created or
would recognize as their own work -- same floor `phases/clean.md` states
explicitly). More than that in one pass is mass-deletion territory (RFC
§ 1.1) regardless of how obvious each file looks individually -- ticket
the rest for confirmation instead of free-deleting past the cap.

`.saipen/kitchen/` is in scope for this sweep too, not just orphan code --
use `phases/clean.md`'s stale definition (owning ticket `DONE` and off
`BOARD.md`, or content fully superseded by `LOG.md`/`CHANGELOG.md`). This
is what actually keeps kitchen/ bounded: `CLEAN` only runs when a user
explicitly asks for it, `HUNT` runs every autonomous pass with no tasking
required, so a kitchen file can't outlive its usefulness for more than one
maintenance cycle.

Ambiguous -> ticket + user confirms.
Findings ticketed (not clean)? STATE -> `PLAN` (or straight to `SCOUT` if
a finding is small/obvious enough to skip planning, same judgment call as
`phases/plan.md`'s size gate) -- work them same as any other `TODO`, board
order = priority.
Nothing found -> LOG one normal Event Graph line per RFC § 1.2 -- `- DATE
[E-###] [parent: E-###] RUN: hunt -> clean @SHORT-HASH` (this exact text
after the taxonomy, not a free-text summary) -- then immediately
transition to `ADD`. This transition is unconditional -- a clean hunt is
never itself a reason to stop, under `goal_mode` or otherwise (RFC § 2.4).
Never invent busywork.

## Perf (user asks specifically, or a ticket calls for it)

Baseline number first (profiler/timer/EXPLAIN -> LOG).
Fix top proven bottleneck -> re-measure same way.
Gain under 20% and uglier -> revert + LOG why.
