# Phase: BUILD

Smallest safe change. Full code: no stubs, null/empty/error paths handled.
Match repo style even if dated; modernizing = separate ticket.
Risky edit: LOG rollback command first.
Scope grows / neighbor broken: new TODO ticket, keep moving.
Ticket touches UI/interface work? Also load UI.md.

After BUILD: LOG one Event Graph line per RFC § 1.2 -- `- DATE [E-###]
[parent: E-###] [T-###] RUN: build -> <what changed, one line>` -- then
checkpoint per § 1.5 (LOG already done; write `BOARD.md` then `STATE.md`
in that order) before STATE -> VERIFY. This is the one checkpoint per
ticket § 1.5 requires, not a log line per tool call or per edit -- BUILD
is usually several edits across one turn; one LOG line summarizing the
ticket's change is correct, a line per file touched is not. Can't complete
safely (unrecoverable error, no write access, the change needs a decision
only the user can make)? STATE -> BLOCKED with the facts -- never force a
broken edit through to VERIFY, and never skip the LOG line even for a
BLOCKED exit.
